# RECO: Recovery Companion

We developed a conversational AI that assists patients with heart failure (HF) who have recently been discharged from the hospital. HF is a condition where the heart struggles to pump blood efficiently, often due to damage or disease affecting the heart's muscle. Patients frequently face worsened symptoms soon after hospital discharge, which if not addressed swiftly, can lead to rehospitalization.

RECO aims to monitor these patients by routinely asking about their symptoms, vital signs, and medication adherence. It will then compile this information into a structured report for their physician. This proactive approach helps in detecting any worsening of the condition early, potentially prompting timely medical interventions. The conversational AI is not designed to diagnose conditions or offer medical advice directly to patients but serves as a crucial communication bridge between patients and their healthcare providers.

## Technical Architecture

RECO is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Streamlit for interactive web interface.
- **Backend:** Python, Flask for API management, and handling server-side logic.
- **AI Model:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing patient data securely.
