# RECO: Recovery Companion

## Why Heart Failure?

1 in 33 Americans suffer from heart failure. Patients who are hospitalized frequently face worsened symptoms soon after discharge which, if not addressed swiftly, can lead to rehospitalization. Approximately 25% of heart failure patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, costing the healthcare system billions annually.

## Product Overview

RECO aims to reduce these high readmission rates by providing continuous, AI-driven monitoring and support for heart failure patients. It collects clinically relevant symptoms information, and then compiles this information into a structured report for their physician.

## Technical Architecture

Our architecture integrates a UI, chatbot agent, database, and summarization engine.

## Conversational AI & Summarization Engine Evaluation

The performance of RECO was evaluated using a combination of human and LLM judges. We first manually evaluated transcripts and summaries generated by RECO ensure accuracy and reliability. We then developed an LLM Judge framework that was able to match human evaluation performance. With that system of evaluation in place, we were able to scalably iterate and improve our product.

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Doctors receive concise summaries, facilitating quicker and better-informed clinical decisions.
- **Scalability:** The system allows for the management of larger patient volumes without overburdening healthcare providers.
- **Patient Engagement:** Studies show and patients agree: the chatbot is easier and more straightforward than traditional forms.
