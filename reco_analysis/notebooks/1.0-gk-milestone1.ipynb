    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the development of a virtual doctor chatbot that interacts with heart failure patients \n",
    "to monitor their progress. The chatbot uses LangChain and GPT-3.5 for natural language processing and response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "1. User Interface (UI): The primary interface for patient interaction.\n",
    "2. Conversational AI Core (GPT-3.5): Processes user input and generates responses.\n",
    "3. Dialogue Manager: Manages user sessions and ensures a logical conversation flow.\n",
    "4. Simulation Toggle: Allows switching between user interaction and simulated patient interaction."
