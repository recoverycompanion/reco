    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the creation of a virtual doctor chatbot using the LangChain framework and GPT-3.5. The chatbot is designed to interact with patients, providing responses based on the context of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components are:\n",
    "1. **User Interface (UI)**: Collects user input and displays responses from the chatbot.\n",
    "2. **Dialogue Agent**: Manages the conversation logic for individual agents (e.g., doctor and patient).\n",
    "3. **Dialogue Simulator**: Simulates conversations between multiple agents to test and demonstrate the chatbot's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component plays a crucial role in the overall interaction flow, from user input to intelligent response generation."
