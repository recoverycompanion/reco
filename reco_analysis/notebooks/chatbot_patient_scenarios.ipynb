    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running simulated conversations between a virtual doctor and synthetic patients. The aim is to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

    "- Hesitates to share information and avoids answering direct questions.\n",
    "- Needs constant reassurance to provide details and frequently gives vague responses.\n",
    "- Expresses confusion when discussing medical terms or vital signs such as respiratory rate, heart rate, and O2 saturation.\n",
    "- Eventually provides the necessary, specific information when probed and reassured.\n",
    "- Uses a variety of hesitation phrases reflecting uncertainty, evasiveness or confusion. Examples of hesitation phrases include, but is not limited to:\n",
    "  **Uncertainty:**\n",
    "  - “I don’t remember exactly” \n",
    "  - “It’s hard to say” \n",

    "- Only use a maximum of one hesitation phrase per response.\n",
    "- Vary sentence structures, including where in the responses the hesitation phrase is placed.\n",

      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling weak and dealing with a cough. Let's dive a little deeper into your symptoms. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, when does it occur?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I do get a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m walking up the stairs. It's not constant, but it certainly catches me off guard.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s important to keep track of any changes in your breathing. Have you had sudden shortness of breath at night, which is known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, yeah, sometimes I wake up at night feeling like I can't catch my breath. It usually goes away after I sit up for a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that at night; it’s good to know it improves when you sit up. Do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven't really tried using more pillows yet, but it might help. I usually just adjust a bit and it seems to work for me.\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that adjusting helps you for now. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, no, I haven't noticed any swelling in my ankles or legs. They seem to be about the same as usual, so no issues there.\n",
      "Doctor: That's reassuring to hear about the absence of swelling. Have you been experiencing any cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, yeah, the cough does seem to be a bit worse at night. It kind of wakes me up sometimes, which is a little annoying.\n",
      "Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that your cough is interrupting your sleep; that sounds frustrating. Have you had any recent chest pain?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, no, I haven't had any chest pain recently. Just the cough and weakness, but nothing sharp or concerning in my chest.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't had any chest pain. Now, have you been feeling more tired than usual or noticed any changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, especially in the afternoons. My mind feels clear enough, but I just don’t have the energy I used to.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me; it's important to monitor your energy levels. Now, let's check in on your vital signs. What is your latest temperature reading?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, I think my temperature was around 97.9 degrees. It seemed pretty normal to me.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update on your temperature. What is your latest heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my heart rate was around 93 beats per minute. It felt a little fast, but I guess that's normal for me lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your heart rate. What is your latest respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my respiratory rate was about 25 breaths per minute. It seems a bit higher than usual, but I didn’t really notice it before.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your latest oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my oxygen saturation was 96 percent. It seemed fine, but I guess it’s good to keep an eye on it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your oxygen saturation level. What is your latest blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my blood pressure was 111 over 60. It seemed a bit low to me, but I didn't feel dizzy or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure reading. Now, what is your latest weight?\n",

      "You mentioned experiencing some dizziness. Have you noticed if it affects your daily activities or if there's anything specific that makes it worse?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, the dizziness does make it hard to do some of my daily activities, like going grocery shopping. It gets worse if I stand up too quickly or if I’m out for too long.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that the dizziness is making it challenging for you to go grocery shopping. It's important to take things slowly when you feel that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, regarding your cough, has it changed at all, or are there any specific triggers that make it worse, aside from at night?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, well, the cough hasn't changed much, but it does seem worse when I'm around dust or strong scents. I've also noticed it gets a bit more persistent after I eat, which is kind of weird.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your cough; it’s helpful to know what triggers it. Let's keep monitoring it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\n",

      "\n",
      "Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns aside from the cough waking you up?\n",

      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that your sleep patterns have been disrupted. It can be really tough to settle back down after waking up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you noticed any particular time of night when you wake up more frequently?\n",

      "Doctor: It's understandable to feel uncomfortable when lying down for too long. Let's move on to another symptom. Do you find that you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um... yes, I’ve been using a couple of extra pillows at night to help me breathe better. It definitely makes it a bit easier to sleep, you know?\n",

      "Doctor: Hello Norma Gray, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um... I've been feeling a bit short of breath lately, especially when I try to do things around the house. It’s kind of confusing because I thought I was getting better after the hospital.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling short of breath, especially when you're trying to do activities around the house. It's important for us to understand this symptom better. Can you tell me if you've experienced any shortness of breath at any specific times, like while resting or during certain activities?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I mostly notice it when I'm doing things like going up the stairs or even just walking around the living room. It feels like I can't catch my breath sometimes, and it makes me a bit anxious.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. I can understand how that would be quite concerning and frustrating. Have you had any sudden shortness of breath at night, maybe waking up feeling like you can't breathe?\n",
      "Patient: Um... no, I haven't really had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep okay, but sometimes I wake up feeling a bit disoriented about my care plan, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that you haven't experienced sudden shortness of breath at night. Now, do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I haven’t needed extra pillows, but sometimes I feel a bit uneasy about how to manage my symptoms. It’s just hard to keep track of everything, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that keeping track of everything can feel overwhelming. It's important to have a clear plan. Let's continue to check on your symptoms. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um... yeah, I have noticed some swelling in my ankles, especially by the end of the day. It kind of worries me because I didn’t have this before the hospital stay.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing swelling in your ankles, especially since it's new for you. It's important for us to monitor this symptom closely. Can you describe how much swelling you're noticing? Is it mild, moderate, or severe?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I'd say the swelling is moderate. It feels puffy, and sometimes my shoes fit a bit tighter than they used to.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information about the swelling; it’s important we keep an eye on it. Now, have you been experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um... no, I haven't really had a cough, especially at night. I just feel a bit more winded than usual, but no coughing fits or anything like that.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't had a cough at night. Now, have you experienced any recent chest pain?\n",
      "Patient: Um... no, I haven't had any chest pain at all. Just some discomfort with the breathing, but nothing sharp or painful in my chest.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that you haven't had any chest pain. Now, how about your energy levels? Have you been feeling more tired than usual or noticed any changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I've definitely been feeling more tired than usual, like I just don’t have the energy I used to. Sometimes I feel a bit foggy, too, which is frustrating because I want to keep up with everything.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand how tiring that can be and how frustrating it must feel to not keep up with everything. Now, let's move on to your vital signs. What is your latest temperature reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my temperature is 97.7 degrees. I didn’t think it was anything to worry about, but I thought I should mention it.\n",
      "Doctor: That's a perfectly fine temperature. Thank you for sharing that. Now, can you tell me what your latest heart rate is?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my heart rate is 75 beats per minute. It seems steady, but I’m not sure if that’s good or bad, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your heart rate; it sounds steady. Now, can you tell me what your latest respiratory rate is?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. It feels a bit faster when I'm feeling short of breath, but I guess that's to be expected.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing your respiratory rate. Next, can you share what your latest oxygen saturation level is?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my oxygen saturation is at 100 percent. I was surprised to see it's so good, especially with the shortness of breath I’ve been feeling.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your oxygen saturation level; that's great to hear. Now, could you please tell me what your latest blood pressure reading is?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my blood pressure is 125 over 69. I think that’s okay, but I’m not really sure what it means for my heart condition.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing your blood pressure reading. Lastly, can you tell me what your latest weight is?\n",
      "Patient: Um... my weight is 131 pounds. I’m not sure if that’s changed much since I got out of the hospital, but I feel like I've been retaining some water.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your weight. Since you mentioned feeling like you've been retaining some water, can you describe how much weight you think you may have gained since your hospital stay?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I think I might have gained about five pounds since I left the hospital. It feels like my clothes are fitting a bit tighter, and that worries me a little.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand your concern about the weight gain, especially since your clothes are fitting tighter. It's important to keep monitoring this. Now, let’s review your current medications. Are you taking any of the following? If not listed, please add any others. \n",

      "\n",
      "Let's talk about the Furosemide you mentioned. How often are you taking it, and have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since you started?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I'm taking Furosemide once a day. I think it helps a little with the swelling, but I still feel like I'm retaining some water.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for the information about your Furosemide. It's good to hear that it helps a little with the swelling. Have you noticed any side effects from taking it?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I haven't really noticed any side effects from the Furosemide, at least not anything I can pinpoint. I just feel like I need to use the bathroom more often, but I know that's part of it.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear that you haven't noticed any significant side effects from the Furosemide, and yes, increased urination is a common effect. Let's ensure everything is on track. Have you been able to keep up with your other medications, like Atorvastatin and Diltiazem?\n",
      "Patient: Um... yes, I've been keeping up with my Atorvastatin and Diltiazem as well. I try to take them at the same time every day, but sometimes I forget, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that you're trying to keep up with your medications. If you ever forget, it might help to set a reminder or keep a medication schedule. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, do you have a plan in place for when you might miss a dose?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I’m not really sure what to do if I miss a dose. I guess I’d just take it as soon as I remember, but I’m not certain if that’s the right approach.\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable to feel uncertain about what to do if you miss a dose. Generally, if you remember close to the time of your next dose, it's usually best to skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. However, if it's a significant time until your next dose, you can take it as soon as you remember. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, have you been monitoring your symptoms regularly, and do you feel comfortable doing so?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I’ve been keeping an eye on my symptoms, but it’s been a bit challenging. I try to note down how I’m feeling each day, but sometimes I forget what to look for.\n",

      "Doctor: Hello Sandra Wallace, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Um, I've been feeling pretty grateful for the care team, really. But, I have noticed some dyspnea on exertion, especially when I'm doing simple tasks like walking to the kitchen.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling grateful for your care team, but I'm sorry to hear about the dyspnea you're experiencing. Can you tell me if you've experienced any sudden shortness of breath at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, not really, I haven't noticed any sudden shortness of breath at night. It’s mostly during the day when I’m moving around, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that for me. Do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven't needed more pillows, I’m managing okay with what I have. It’s just, um, when I do lie down for too long, I feel a little tightness in my chest sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear about the tightness in your chest when lying down. Let's keep an eye on that. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven't noticed any swelling in my ankles or legs, which is good. I’ve been keeping an eye on that since it was a concern before.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that you haven't noticed any swelling. Have you been experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t really had a cough, especially not at night. Just the dyspnea during the day, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. Have you experienced any recent chest pain?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t had any chest pain recently, which is a relief. Just focusing on managing the dyspnea when I’m active, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate you sharing that with me. How about your energy levels? Are you feeling more tired than usual or have you noticed any changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my energy levels have been a bit lower than usual, I guess. I feel more tired after doing everyday things, but mentally I’m still clear, which is good.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's important to monitor your energy levels. Now, let's check on your vital signs. What is your latest temperature reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest temperature reading is 97.6 degrees. I’ve been feeling pretty stable in that regard, thankfully.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear. What is your latest heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest heart rate is 78 beats per minute. It seems to be pretty steady, which is good.\n",
      "Doctor: What is your latest respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. It feels okay, but I’m still a bit winded when I’m active.\n",
      "Doctor: What is your latest oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest oxygen saturation level is 98 percent. That seems to be holding steady, which is reassuring.\n",
      "Doctor: What is your latest blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest blood pressure reading is 120 over 97. It seems a bit on the higher side, but, um, I’m not feeling any symptoms from it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure reading. What is your latest weight?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my latest weight is 130 pounds. I’ve been trying to keep it stable, but it’s been a bit of a challenge lately.\n",

      "Patient: Um, I haven't really experienced any major side effects from my medications, which is a relief. Just a little bit of dizziness sometimes, but nothing too concerning.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear that the side effects haven't been major. Dizziness can be concerning, though. Can you tell me more about when you experience this dizziness? Is it related to any specific activities or positions?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I tend to feel dizzy mostly when I stand up too quickly or, um, after I've been sitting for a while. It usually passes after a moment, but it can be a bit unsettling.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel unsettled when that happens. Remember to take your time when changing positions. \n",

      "Doctor: Hello again! Let's continue with our check-in. I appreciate the information you've already provided. Since we've talked about your medications, let's go back to your symptoms. You mentioned feeling a bit dizzy when standing up too quickly. How often does that happen to you?\n",
      "Patient: Um, the dizziness happens maybe a couple of times a week, usually when I get up from sitting or lying down. I try to take it slow, but sometimes it catches me off guard.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's good to know you're being cautious when getting up. Let's touch on your recovery journey. Have you noticed any changes in your daily activities or routines due to these symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I've had to slow down a bit with my daily activities, like, um, doing the laundry or even grocery shopping. I find that I need to take more breaks than I used to, which is a bit frustrating.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand how that can be frustrating, and it's important to listen to your body. It's good that you're taking breaks when needed. Have you noticed any other symptoms or changes in your health that we haven't discussed yet?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t really noticed any other significant symptoms or changes in my health. Just the same dyspnea and a bit of dizziness when I stand up too quickly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms as you recover. Now, let's go back to your energy levels. You mentioned feeling more tired than usual. Are there specific activities that seem to wear you out the most?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I find that simple things like taking a shower or cleaning up around the house really tire me out. It feels like I need to rest for a while after those activities, which is, um, definitely different from how I used to feel.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like those activities are quite taxing for you right now. Have you found any strategies or techniques that help you manage your fatigue during these tasks?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven't really found any specific strategies that work well for managing the fatigue, to be honest. I try to take breaks and pace myself, but it can be tough to balance everything.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing with fatigue. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed at times. Have you had a chance to talk to your healthcare provider about these difficulties?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t had a chance to talk to my healthcare provider about these difficulties yet. I guess I’ve just been trying to manage on my own and see how things go.\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable to want to manage things on your own, but it's important to keep your healthcare provider in the loop, especially with the symptoms you've described. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you been able to keep up with any light physical activity, like walking or stretching?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’ve been trying to keep up with some light walking, but it’s been a bit tough. I usually manage a short walk around the block, but I have to take it slow and rest often.\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a good approach to keep moving while listening to your body. It's great that you're still managing to get out for those short walks. How do you feel after those walks? Do you find that they help your overall mood or energy levels?\n",
      "Patient: Um, after those short walks, I usually feel a little better, but I still need to rest afterwards. It helps my mood a bit, but I wouldn't say it boosts my energy levels significantly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s good to hear that the walks help a bit with your mood. Have you noticed any changes in your sleeping patterns since your discharge?\n",

      "Patient: Oh, um... I've been feeling okay overall, but I have this cough that won't seem to go away. It’s not too bad, but it’s definitely annoying.\n",
      "Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that you’re dealing with a persistent cough; that must be frustrating. Can you tell me if you've experienced a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um... yeah, I do notice the cough can get a bit worse at night. It sometimes wakes me up, but I just sit up for a bit, and then it usually calms down.\n",

      "Patient: Um... I've noticed my blood pressure has been pretty consistent, around that 114 over 80 mark. My heart rate and oxygen levels seem stable too, but sometimes I wonder if the cough might be affecting it a little.\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like you're doing a good job monitoring your vital signs. It's understandable to wonder if the cough might be impacting your readings. Can you tell me if there are any specific activities or times when the cough seems to worsen?\n",
      "Patient: I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.\n",

      "Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling anxious, and it sounds like your heart racing is concerning for you. Let's talk about your breathing. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, when does it occur?\n",
      "Patient: Um... I haven't really had any shortness of breath, but I do feel a bit winded when I, ah, climb the stairs. It just feels like I’m not getting enough air sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s important to monitor those feelings. Let's move on to another symptom. Have you had sudden shortness of breath at night, also known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds challenging to deal with shortness of breath during your daily activities. Have you had sudden shortness of breath at night, also known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's understandable that waking up short of breath can be unsettling. Now, do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I think I might need a couple more pillows. It definitely helps me breathe a bit better when I’m lying down, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that using more pillows helps you breathe better while lying down. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I’ve noticed some swelling in my ankles, especially at the end of the day. It can get a bit uncomfortable, you know?\n",

      "Patient: I'm not really sure what you mean by shortness of breath. I mean, I breathe fine most of the time, I think.\n",
      "Doctor: That's perfectly fine. Sometimes, it can be subtle. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. Sometimes I wake up feeling a bit uneasy, but it's hard to say if that's related or not.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I’d rather not say. Sometimes I just feel more comfortable with a few pillows, but it’s hard to describe exactly what helps me breathe.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you might be experiencing some changes when you're active. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. Sometimes I wake up feeling a bit off, but, um, I don't want to discuss that right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand, and we can focus on other things. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Gerald Watson, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling, um, okay, I guess? It's hard to say, just trying to take it easy since I got out.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that it can be tough to assess how you're feeling right now. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure if I've noticed anything new. It’s hard to describe, but I feel like I might be a bit more tired than usual.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure what you mean by shortness of breath. I feel like I breathe okay most of the time, but sometimes I guess I get a little winded when I’m walking.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes I feel a bit out of breath, but it doesn't happen all the time, so I don't know if it's something to worry about.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and it's good to be mindful of changes in your breathing. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I need to prop myself up. It's hard to say, but I feel okay most of the time when I'm lying down.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the swelling. My legs feel a bit heavy sometimes, but I don't want to say it's anything serious.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes I cough a little, but it doesn't seem like a big deal, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand your perspective, and it's important to keep an eye on those symptoms. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes I feel a little pain, but it doesn't happen all the time, so I'm not too worried about it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I feel like I might be a bit more tired than usual, but I don’t know if it's anything to be concerned about.\n",

      "Patient: I'm not sure, but I think my temperature seems normal. I can check if you need me to.\n",
