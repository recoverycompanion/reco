    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running simulated conversations between a virtual doctor and synthetic patients. The aim is to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

      "Patient: Yeah, um... I've noticed a little swelling in my ankles, especially after I've been on my feet for a while. It seems to go down a bit when I elevate my legs, though.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about the swelling in your ankles. It's good that elevating your legs helps. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had a cough at all, um... I think my lungs are doing well, and I haven’t noticed any wheezing or anything like that.\n",
      "Doctor: That's excellent to hear that your lungs are doing well. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain lately, um... just a few little twinges here and there, but nothing that really worries me.\n",

      "Patient: My blood pressure is 93 over 62, um... it's a bit on the lower side, but I guess that’s been pretty typical for me lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure reading. Lastly, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is 187 pounds, um... I’ve been trying to watch what I eat and stay active, so I’m glad it hasn’t gone up too much.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your appetite. It's important to maintain a balanced diet during your recovery. Have you noticed any changes in your fluid intake or any signs of dehydration?\n",
      "Patient: I’ve been trying to drink enough fluids, um... but I do sometimes forget, especially if I’m busy doing chores. I haven’t really felt dehydrated, though, so I think I’m managing okay.\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that you’re managing your fluid intake, but just a reminder to keep up with it, especially when you're busy. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns aside from feeling comfortable while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t really noticed any changes in my sleep patterns, um... I still sleep through the night without waking up too much, which is nice because I really value my rest.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that you're getting good rest. Let’s circle back to your medications briefly: Have you had any concerns about taking Jardiance or noticed any side effects from it?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t had any major concerns with Jardiance, um... it seems to be working fine for me, but I did notice I might be going to the bathroom a bit more often, which is something I’m keeping track of.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please tell me your current weight again?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is still 187 pounds, um... I’ve been trying to stick to my meal plan and not indulge too much, especially with all the holiday treats around!\n",

      "Patient: Um, well, I’ve been feeling a bit off, actually. I’ve had some chest pain and, ah, I get short of breath pretty easily, especially when I try to do anything active.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. It's important we address these symptoms. Can you tell me if you've had any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had that happen, thank goodness. I mostly just feel it during the day when I’m, like, walking around or doing chores.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't needed to do that yet, but I do find myself a bit more comfortable if I'm not flat on my back, you know? It just feels easier to breathe that way.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I've noticed some swelling in my ankles, especially after I've been on my feet for a while. It's kind of annoying, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that the swelling can be frustrating. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't really had a cough, um, just some occasional throat clearing, but nothing that keeps me up at night or anything like that. Just mainly the chest pain and the breathlessness.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that for me. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Yeah, I've had some chest pain, um, it comes and goes, but it feels pretty sharp sometimes, like a tightness in my chest. It's definitely getting a bit concerning for me.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that the chest pain is concerning for you. It's important we keep an eye on that. Could you please provide me with your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my temperature was 98.0 when I checked it earlier. So, um, I guess that's normal, but I still feel off.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate was around 106 when I checked it, which seems a bit high to me. I mean, I’ve been trying to relax, but it just feels like my heart is racing sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. What is your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate was about 20. I’ve noticed I’m breathing a bit faster when I’m moving around, but it settles down when I’m resting.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. What is your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation was at 96%. It seems okay, but, um, I still feel a bit winded sometimes, especially when I try to do much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your current blood pressure?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing about your sleep patterns. It can be really frustrating to not get restful sleep. Let’s revisit your medications for a moment. Have you had any recent changes in how you take your medications or any issues with refills?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t had any issues with refills, but I did forget to take my Metoprolol a couple of times last week. Um, I’m trying to set reminders on my phone to help me remember, but sometimes I just get caught up in what I’m doing.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know about the reminders; that's a great step to help you remember. Have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness when you change positions, like standing up?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that experience with dizziness. Let's continue to monitor how you're feeling. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, I mentioned earlier that I’m at 147 pounds now, but, um, I feel like I’ve been fluctuating a bit more, maybe due to the swelling and everything. It’s hard to tell sometimes with how things have been going.\n",

      "Patient: I haven't really noticed a big change in my thirst, but I do feel like I'm urinating more frequently, especially at night. It's, um, kind of annoying having to get up so often.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your urination. It can be quite bothersome to have to get up frequently at night. Next, could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is still around 106, I think. It just feels like it’s racing a lot of the time, which can be a bit unsettling.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had that, thankfully. I usually sleep okay, but I do feel a bit restless sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven’t experienced sudden shortness of breath at night. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: No, I don’t really need to use extra pillows. I can usually lie down just fine, but I do like to keep my head a bit elevated just in case.\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to know you can lie down comfortably. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I've noticed a bit of swelling in my ankles, especially by the end of the day. It seems to get worse if I've been on my feet for too long.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Swelling in the ankles can be concerning, especially after being on your feet. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, not really at night, but I do have this productive cough during the day. It's, like, mostly phlegmy, which is kind of gross, but it doesn't seem to bother me too much otherwise.\n",
      "Doctor: That's understandable; a productive cough can be bothersome. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had any chest pain lately. Just a little tightness sometimes, but it usually goes away pretty quick.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm relieved to hear that you haven't had any chest pain recently. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",

      "Doctor: That's good to hear that your temperature is normal. What is your current heart rate?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Joseph Richardson, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Um, well, I've been feeling, uh, a bit winded when I do things like walking to the kitchen or, you know, just getting up from my chair. It’s not too bad, but I definitely notice it.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that shortness of breath. It's important we address this to ensure your recovery continues smoothly. Have you had any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I haven’t had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep pretty well, but I do sometimes feel a bit more tired than I used to.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's not uncommon to feel more tired during recovery. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I haven't really noticed any swelling in my ankles or legs. They feel pretty normal, just a bit heavy sometimes after I've been on my feet for a while.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't noticed any swelling. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had a cough, um, at least not a persistent one. Just the occasional tickle in my throat, but nothing that keeps me up at night.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to know. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain, um, just the usual tightness sometimes, but it’s nothing I can't handle. Just trying to take it easy and not overdo it.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear you're managing the tightness and taking it easy. Now, could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I noticed it was a bit higher than normal, but I thought it might just be from, you know, being a little under the weather lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. It seems to be steady, which I guess is a good sign, but I’m not really sure what it should be.\n",
      "Doctor: That's a steady heart rate, which is a good sign. Now, could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I’ve noticed I breathe a bit faster when I’m active, but it settles down when I sit still.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that. Can you please provide your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation is, um, 96 percent. I think that’s pretty good, right? I try to keep my breathing steady, especially when I’m feeling a bit out of breath.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, 96 percent is indeed a good oxygen saturation level. Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is, um, 157 over 98. The nurse mentioned it was a bit high, but I’ve been trying to watch my salt intake and stick to my medications.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you're monitoring your salt intake and medications. Let's move on to reviewing the medications you're currently taking. Are you on any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking:\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your medications with me. It's great that you're keeping track of them. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I’m not taking any diuretics right now. My doctor didn’t prescribe any when I left the hospital, so I’ve just been sticking to what I have.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that for me. Based on what you've shared, here's an overview of where you are in your recovery and what you can expect in the coming days and weeks. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and adhering to your medication regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can you tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I noticed I gained a little since I got home, but I think it might be from not moving around as much as I should.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing your weight. It's understandable to notice changes, especially if you're less active right now. Just to check in, could you tell me how you're feeling about your recovery process overall? Are there any concerns or questions you would like to discuss?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling, um, okay about my recovery, but I do worry a bit about the shortness of breath. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right to get back to my old self.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling okay overall, but I understand your concern about the shortness of breath. It's important to address that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I’ve been trying to watch what I eat, but it's a bit tough with, you know, all the holiday treats around lately.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that the holiday treats can be tempting! It's great that you're trying to watch what you eat. Now, let's continue to monitor your recovery. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I’ve been feeling a little warm, but I thought it was just the house being too cozy, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: You've already shared that your temperature is 100.0 degrees. Next, could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. I was a bit surprised it was in the normal range, especially since I've been feeling a little off lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I noticed it picks up a bit when I’m moving around, but it calms down when I'm resting.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your respiratory rate. Now, could you please tell me your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is, um, 96 percent. I try to take deep breaths when I feel a bit out of breath, and it seems to help keep it steady.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is, um, 157 over 98. The nurse said it was a bit high, but I’m trying not to stress about it too much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure. Let's move on to reviewing your medications. Are you currently taking any diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I'm not taking any diuretics like Furosemide or Torsemide. My doctor didn't think I needed them after my last hospital stay, so I've just been sticking to the Losartan and my other meds.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying your medications. Just to ensure I have all the information, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I’ve been keeping an eye on it, but, you know, with the holidays, it’s a little hard to resist those delicious meals and treats!\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your weight. Now, could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I’ve been feeling a bit warm, but I thought it might just be the cozy blankets I’ve been using lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's move forward with our check-in. Can you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. It's been pretty consistent, which I guess is a good thing, but sometimes I can feel it racing a bit when I'm, you know, doing simple tasks.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your heart rate. Now, could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I’ve noticed it goes up a bit when I’m walking around the house, but it settles down nicely when I sit down for a while.\n",

      "Doctor: That's good to hear! Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",

      "Doctor: That's a normal respiratory rate, which is good to hear. Can you provide your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation is 98%. I check it with my little monitor at home, and it always seems to be in a good range, so that gives me peace of mind.\n",
      "Doctor: That's excellent to hear that your oxygen saturation is at 98%. Now, could you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is 178 over 61. Um... I know the top number is a bit high, but I’ve been trying to monitor my salt intake and follow the doctor’s advice.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for your diligence in monitoring your health, Victor. Have you had any changes in your appetite or any weight fluctuations?\n",
      "Patient: My appetite has been okay overall, but I’ve had some days where I feel less hungry, especially if my stomach feels a bit bloated from the medications. I haven't really lost or gained any weight, just staying around 183 pounds.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for the update on your appetite and weight. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: My sleep patterns have been pretty consistent, but I do wake up occasionally feeling a bit restless. I think it’s mostly just from worrying about my health, but I usually fall back asleep fairly quickly.\n",

      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty about the tightness you're feeling. Now, could you please provide your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature is 99.0 degrees. It's been a little on the higher side, but I think that's just from, you know, being a bit under the weather lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update on your temperature. Could you please let me know your heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my heart rate is 80 beats per minute. It seems pretty steady, so I haven't been too worried about it.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, could you please tell me your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is 97%. It seems good, but I do wonder if it drops a bit when I'm feeling more breathless.\n",

      "Patient: I've noticed my appetite isn't as strong as it used to be; I used to enjoy cooking, but now I just don't feel like it sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I find myself skipping meals here and there, which might be affecting my weight a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable that a decreased appetite can make it challenging to maintain your weight. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you experienced any feelings of anxiety or depression since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: I haven't really felt any anxiety or depression since I got home, which is nice. I mean, I have my moments, but I try to keep myself busy with gardening and reading to stay positive.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling generally positive and keeping busy with activities you enjoy. Let's continue monitoring your recovery. Could you tell me if you've experienced any issues with sleep, besides feeling tired in the mornings?\n",
      "Patient: I haven't had major sleep issues, but I do wake up a bit more often than I used to, sometimes because of the shortness of breath. I try to go back to sleep, but it can be a little frustrating at times.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds frustrating to wake up often. Let's focus on your vital signs again. What is your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is 185 pounds. I’ve been trying to keep it steady, but I feel like it fluctuates a bit more lately, especially when I don’t eat as regularly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's check in on your vital signs once more. Could you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is 177 over 80. I know that’s a bit high, so I’m trying to keep an eye on my salt intake and stay active as much as I can.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding. Could you please tell me your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is 17. It feels like I've been trying to focus on taking deeper breaths, especially when I feel that shortness of breath coming on.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your response. What is your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is 94. I’ve been trying to stay active, but sometimes I catch myself needing to sit down and take a few deep breaths when it drops a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's check in on your heart rate now. What is your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is 80. It feels pretty steady, but I try to stay calm and avoid any sudden movements that might get my heart racing.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",

      "Patient: No, I haven't had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep through, but the abdominal pain has woken me up a couple of times.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Daniel. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Ah, yeah, I do use a couple of pillows to prop myself up. It just feels easier to breathe that way.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know, Daniel. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Yeah, actually, my ankles have been a bit swollen. It's not too bad, but it's noticeable by the end of the day.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Daniel. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't really had a cough. It's mostly just the abdominal pain and a bit of swelling in my ankles.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, Daniel. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain lately. Just that abdominal pain, like I mentioned.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you, Daniel. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Ah, yeah, I do feel more tired than usual. Sometimes I get a bit forgetful, but nothing too drastic.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing all that information, Daniel. Let's move on to your vital signs. Could you please provide your latest temperature reading?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello John Sanders, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I'm doing okay, I guess. It’s hard to say if everything is going perfectly, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and it's completely normal to feel that way after being discharged. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since you left the hospital?\n",
      "Patient: Well, um, I don’t want to worry you, but maybe I've felt a bit more short of breath now and then. It's hard to describe, really.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing more shortness of breath. Could you tell me if this shortness of breath occurs at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, it happens mostly when I'm doing a little more than sitting around. I think, uh, maybe climbing stairs? But I’m not really sure if that's a big deal.\n",
      "Doctor: It can be concerning to notice changes like that. Let's keep a close eye on it. Have you experienced any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I don’t think so, not really. I mean, I’d rather not say if I have or haven’t, if that’s okay?\n",
      "Doctor: That's perfectly okay; we can focus on what you're comfortable sharing. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes I do use a pillow, but it’s hard to say if it helps or if I just like having it there.\n",
      "Doctor: That's understandable; pillows can provide comfort in different ways. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t want to make a big deal out of it, but sometimes my legs feel a bit heavy. I can’t quite describe this swelling thing, though.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. It's important to note those feelings of heaviness. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I have a cough, to be honest. Maybe a little one now and then, but I don’t think it’s anything serious, right?\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that you don't think it's anything serious, but we'll keep an eye on it. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure how to explain it, but I think maybe I haven’t felt any chest pain. I mean, I don’t want to say it’s been completely fine, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate your careful consideration of your symptoms. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I think, um, maybe I feel a bit more tired sometimes, but it’s hard to say if it’s just because I’m getting older. I wouldn't say my mind feels foggy, though; I’m just, you know, a bit slower these days, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me; it’s important to recognize those feelings. Could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t remember exactly what it was. I think it might have been around 98 or something? But, uh, I’m not really sure.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think my heart rate is, uh, maybe around 78? But, you know, I’m not really into keeping track of those numbers all the time.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’m not sure what that is exactly. I think maybe it was around 18? But, really, I don't pay much attention to it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please provide your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think my oxygen saturation is around 100? But honestly, I’m not really sure how important that is right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update. Could you please tell me your blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t remember the exact numbers for that. I think it was something like 137 over, uh, 62? But I’m not really sure if that’s important to focus on.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Lastly, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, weight? I think it’s around 149 pounds, but I don’t really keep a close eye on that. Weight can kind of fluctuate, right?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update. Could you please tell me if you’ve had any recent changes in your medication regimen since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I'm still on the same medications, you know? I take Isosorbide Dinitrate and Atorvastatin, but I’m kind of fuzzy on the details. Is that really something we need to go over?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for confirming your medications. Let's review the medications you are currently taking. Are you also on any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking: \n",
      "\n",
      "- ACE inhibitors (like Lisinopril or Enalapril)\n",
      "- Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (like Losartan)\n",

      "- GLP-1 agonists (like Liraglutide)\n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know if any of these apply to you.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t really think I’m on any of those. I mean, I’ve heard of some of them, but I, uh, I’m not sure if they apply to me. Can we maybe talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your willingness to share today. Let's focus on your weight again for just a moment. Have you noticed any significant changes in your weight since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t think there’s been anything too significant. I mean, it’s hard to say; maybe I feel a little different, but I don’t really keep close track of it, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty. It helps me understand your situation better. Could you please tell me if you’ve experienced any changes in your appetite or eating habits since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t really want to get into that too much. Maybe my appetite is a bit different, but it’s hard to say if it’s really changed or if I’m just, you know, not as hungry sometimes?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand your feelings about discussing your appetite. Thank you for sharing what you feel comfortable with. Let's move on. Can you tell me if you've experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness lately?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I think I’ve felt a little dizzy sometimes, but it’s hard to say when exactly. I mean, I’d rather not discuss that right now if that’s okay?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s check in on how you're managing your overall health. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, sleep patterns? I’m not really sure if there’s been any big changes. I mean, some nights I sleep okay, but I think sometimes I just lie awake thinking about things, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your sleep. It’s common to have those thoughts at night. Now, can we return to your vital signs? Could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your weight since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I've mentioned my weight before, but I don’t really keep track closely. It’s hard to say if it’s gone up or down; you know how it is when you don't step on the scale every day?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding. Let’s focus on your vital signs again. Can you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your blood pressure since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t really know if I’ve noticed any changes in my blood pressure. I mean, it seems like it’s probably about the same, but I just don’t pay attention to it that much, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Can you tell me if you've had any changes in your physical activity level since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, physical activity? I think it’s hard to say if there’s been a big change. I mean, I try to do a little walking, but I sometimes feel a bit tired, so I don’t push myself too much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that insight into your physical activity. Could you please let me know your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I mentioned my heart rate before, but let me see... I believe it’s around 78? But honestly, I’m not too focused on those numbers, so I could be off a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's continue with your vital signs. Could you please tell me your current respiratory rate?\n",

      "Doctor: Hello Nancy Barnes, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, hi there. Well, um, I don’t really remember exactly how I’ve been feeling. It's hard to say, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that it can be tough to keep track of how you're feeling. Let's try to break it down a bit. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Um, well, I’ve had this cough lately, but I don't think that's too important. I’d rather not say much more about it right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that cough. It's important we keep an eye on it. Have you had any shortness of breath at all?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure what you mean by shortness of breath. I can't quite describe this feeling, but it’s, um, not really something I want to discuss right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate you sharing what you feel comfortable with. Let's move on to another important aspect. Could you please tell me if you have noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I don't think that's important. Maybe it’s just a little, but I'm not really sure if it’s swelling or something else. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that it can be overwhelming to discuss everything at once. Let’s take it step by step. Can you share your current weight with me?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, my weight? I think it’s around, let me think... maybe 125 pounds? But I’m really not sure if that matters much right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that weight. Let’s focus on your vital signs now. Could you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I remember the numbers exactly. Um, maybe it's something like 102 over, um, 57? But honestly, I don't really see why that’s so important.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure. That information is helpful. Can you tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about my heart rate. Um, I think it’s, maybe around 91? But I don’t really keep track of those things closely.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please let me know your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure what you mean by respiratory rate. It’s, um, a little confusing for me, but maybe it’s around 19? I don't think I really know how to check that.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that respiratory rate. Now, can you provide your oxygen saturation level, if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really familiar with what oxygen saturation is. Um, I think maybe it’s around 93, but I’m not sure how important that is either. Can we just talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your patience, and thank you for sharing what you have. Let’s focus on your medications now. Are you currently taking any heart medications? If so, could you list them for me?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, medications? Yes, I think I’m taking some heart medications, but, um, I’d rather not say all of them right now. I know there’s Lisinopril and, um, Furosemide? But I can’t recall the others off the top of my head.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that you're taking Lisinopril and Furosemide. Can you tell me if you're also taking any other medications, such as a beta-blocker or a diuretic?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I want to go into all the details right now. Um, I think there’s Metoprolol and maybe something like Pravastatin? But I can't remember everything, and I don’t think it’s that important to go over it all.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that you might be taking Metoprolol and Pravastatin. Let's focus on your recovery a little more. Can you tell me if you've experienced any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I don't think that's very important right now. Honestly, I’m not sure if I’ve had any chest pain recently, maybe a little discomfort, but it’s hard to say. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty and the information you've shared. Let's focus on how you're feeling. Have you experienced any fatigue or sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I mean, I feel a bit tired sometimes, but I can't quite describe this feeling. It’s hard to say if it's anything serious.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your responses, and I’m here to support you. Let's talk about your oxygen saturation level again. If you have a way to check it, what is your current oxygen saturation?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not quite sure if I should check that again. I think, um, it might be around 93, but I’m really not sure how accurate that is. Is this really necessary to go over?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let’s focus on one last vital sign. Can you tell me if you have checked your temperature recently? If so, what was it?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about my temperature right now. I think it was, um, around 98.9? But honestly, I can't remember if that’s normal or not. Do we really need to go over all of this?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that your temperature was around 98.9. Let's move on to your heart rate. Can you confirm if your heart rate is still around 91?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I can confirm that. I think it might still be around 91, but, um, it's hard to keep track of those things. Do we have to keep discussing these numbers?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand it can be a lot to keep track of. Thank you for your honesty. Let’s focus on one more vital sign. Can you tell me if you have any recent weight changes since your last check?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about any weight changes. I think I’m still around 125 pounds, but it’s hard to say if that’s changed. I just don’t think it’s really that important right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let’s move on to your medications. Are you taking any diuretics, such as Furosemide or any others?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I mentioned Furosemide before, but I’d rather not go into too many details about my medications. I’m not really sure if I’m taking any others right now, you know? It just gets a bit confusing for me.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing what you can. Let’s focus on your recovery. Can you tell me if you’ve had any recent changes in your sleeping patterns, or are you waking up feeling rested?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure how to describe my sleeping patterns. Sometimes I wake up feeling a bit, um, not so rested, but I can't quite figure out why. It’s hard to say if it’s anything serious.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your openness. Let's focus on your recovery a bit more. Can you let me know if you've experienced any sudden changes in your appetite?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure if I want to talk about my appetite right now. I think it’s been a little off, but I don’t know if that’s important. Maybe I just, um, forget to eat sometimes?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate you sharing what you feel comfortable with. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you had any issues with dizziness or lightheadedness?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I want to get into that right now. Maybe I feel a bit dizzy sometimes, but it’s hard to say if it’s anything serious. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate your willingness to share what you can. Let's focus on your medications again. Have you been taking Furosemide regularly as prescribed?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I’ve been taking Furosemide, but I can’t really remember if it’s been regular. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you know? I just don’t want to go into too many details right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand that it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. Let's simplify this. Can you tell me if you have experienced any changes in your weight since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I’ve had any changes in my weight since I got out. I mean, um, I think I’m still around 125 pounds, but it’s hard to keep track of that stuff. Do you think that’s really important?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your responses. Let’s focus on your medications a bit more. Are you taking any other medications besides Lisinopril and Furosemide?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I want to list all my medications right now. I think, um, there’s also Metoprolol and maybe Cilostazol? But I don’t remember everything off the top of my head, and I’m not sure it’s that important.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that you might be taking Metoprolol and Cilostazol. Let's check in about your current symptoms again. Have you experienced any sudden changes in your energy levels?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure how to describe my energy levels. Sometimes I feel a bit more tired than usual, but it’s hard to say if that’s due to anything specific. I don’t want to dwell on it too much right now.\n",

      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing some shortness of breath. Can you tell me if it occurs at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",

      "Patient: Oh, um, well, I don’t think that’s important right now. I mean, I can't quite describe if it's really sudden or not, but I’ll, you know, try to remember if it happens again.\n",
      "Doctor: That's completely understandable. Let’s move on for now. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, well, you know, I try not to look too closely at that. It’s hard to say if there's any swelling, but maybe a little? I’m not really sure.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that it can be difficult to assess swelling. Just keep an eye on it for now. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",

      "Patient: Uh, oxygen saturation? I think I heard something about that, but I’m not really sure what it is. Maybe it’s around 97? I can’t quite remember, honestly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let's continue with your vital signs. What is your blood pressure?\n",

      "Patient: I'm not really keeping track of my weight, to be honest. I think I might be around 183 pounds, but, you know, I don't weigh myself every day, so it's hard to say for sure.\n",

      "Patient: I don’t know if I’d say I feel more tired, but, um, maybe I’m just not bouncing back as quickly as I used to? It’s hard to say if there’s been any big changes in how I think or anything like that.\n",

      "Patient: Oh, hi there. Well, it’s hard to say, but I guess I’m doing okay? Just the usual stuff, I suppose.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing, Peter. Can you tell me more about any specific symptoms you might be experiencing? Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’m not sure what you’re asking exactly. I guess I’ve noticed some... like, maybe a little trouble when I’m moving around? It’s not too bad, really.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad you mentioned that. Just to clarify, when you say you're having a little trouble moving around, are you experiencing any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, yes, I think that’s what it is... shortness of breath, maybe? It kind of happens when I’m doing more than just sitting, but I don’t really want to dive into that right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Peter. It's completely okay to take things at your own pace. Have you experienced any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure, honestly. I can’t really remember if that’s happened or not. Maybe it’s just been a little harder to sleep, but I don’t think that’s important right now.\n",
      "Doctor: That’s completely understandable, Peter. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Patient:  \n",
      "Oh, well, I mean, I don’t want to say too much about that. It’s hard to describe, but maybe sometimes I do? I just kind of adjust a bit when I’m lying down, I think.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Peter. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I want to get into that right now. I mean, I think my legs might feel a bit different sometimes, but it's hard to say if it's swelling or just... you know, normal stuff?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Peter. Let's move on to another symptom. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the cough thing. I mean, I might have cleared my throat a couple of times at night, but I wouldn't say it's anything serious. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Of course, Peter. Let's focus on your vital signs. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure what my temperature is at the moment. Maybe it's... I don't know, something around normal? It’s not like I’ve been keeping track or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty, Peter. Let's move on to your heart rate. Do you happen to know what your heart rate is?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, heart rate? I think it was... maybe around 70? But I don’t really remember exactly, to be honest. It’s hard to keep track of all these numbers.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Peter. Now, could you let me know your respiratory rate?\n",

      "Patient: Patient:  \n",
      "Oh, the oxygen saturation? I think I heard it was something like 99? But, you know, I don’t really pay much attention to those numbers. It all seems a bit overwhelming.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, Peter. Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure, if you have that available?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not entirely sure about the blood pressure, to be honest. Maybe it was something like... um, I don't really remember right now. Is this really necessary?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Peter. It sounds like you're on a few important medications. Just to clarify, how often are you taking Lisinopril and Metoprolol?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the exact schedule. I think it’s, um, maybe once a day or something? I just take them when I remember, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty, Peter. It’s important to take your medications consistently. Now, could you please tell me how often you’re taking Atorvastatin?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that one either. I think it's maybe once a day, but I can't quite remember? It's just a lot to keep track of, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand, Peter. It can be overwhelming to remember all the details. Let's focus on one thing at a time. How often are you taking Aspirin?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that either. Maybe it’s, um, once a day? I guess I just take it when I think about it, but it’s hard to keep everything straight in my head.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your patience, Peter. Let's focus on your medications a little more. Have you noticed any side effects from the medications you are taking?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure if I want to discuss side effects right now. I mean, I think there might be some things? But I can't quite describe them. It’s just... you know, medication stuff.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Peter. Let's keep it simple. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I mean, my appetite seems okay, but maybe it’s a little different? I guess I just eat when I feel like it, so it’s hard to say if anything’s changed.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Peter. Let’s check in on another vital sign. Can you tell me what your current weight is?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I think I mentioned it earlier, but I guess it’s around 162 pounds? But you know, it’s just a number, right? I don’t always pay attention to it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience, Peter. I appreciate your honesty throughout our conversation. Let's move on to your next vital sign. Could you tell me your current blood pressure if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the blood pressure right now. I think it was something like... was it 160 over something? I can’t quite remember, and I don’t know if it’s that important to discuss.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding, Peter. Let’s focus on your current blood pressure when you have the chance to check it. Meanwhile, have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I want to talk about chest pain right now. I mean, I think... maybe I felt something once or twice, but it’s hard to say if it was really pain or just discomfort? Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your openness, Peter. Let's focus on how you're feeling overall. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I guess I feel a bit more tired sometimes, but it's hard to say if it's just age or the medications or, you know, life in general? I’m not sure about the mental clarity part; it just comes and goes, I suppose.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Peter. I appreciate your honesty. Let's check on your vital signs again. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",

      "Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by \"mental clarity.\" I mean, I feel a bit tired sometimes, but it's hard to say if that's just because I’m getting older.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that age can certainly play a role in how you feel. Let's move on to your vital signs. Could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: Um, well, I don’t really want to say my weight right now. It’s just a number, you know? Maybe it’s around what it usually is?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing how you're feeling. Could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature? I don’t really remember exactly, but I think it was, like, normal. Maybe around 98 or something?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Can you tell me your heart rate?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Cynthia. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Well, I mean, there’s this... um, chest pain sometimes. But I’m not sure if it’s really that serious or just, you know, something I ate.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing chest pain. It's important we monitor this closely. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes it feels a bit harder to breathe, but I don’t know if that’s, um, normal or not?\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable to feel uncertain about your breathing, especially after being discharged. Can you tell me if you've had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure I want to get into that right now. Is it really necessary to talk about all this?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate your honesty. Let's take it one step at a time. Can you please tell me if you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that either. I mean, maybe I do sometimes? It’s hard to say; I just try to get comfortable however I can.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your willingness to share, Cynthia. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really certain about that either. I mean, my feet might look a little different sometimes, but I don’t think it's anything major... or at least I hope not.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and it’s perfectly okay to feel uncertain. Let’s check in on a few more things to help you feel more comfortable. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure I really want to discuss that right now. It’s hard to say if it’s a cough or just, um, something else, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand, Cynthia. Let’s move forward. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, yes, I mentioned the chest pain earlier. But it's really not that bad, I think? I mean, it comes and goes, so maybe it’s nothing to worry about.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience, Cynthia. I want to ensure we have a complete picture. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the tiredness thing. I mean, I guess I do feel a bit more, um, sluggish sometimes, but I don't know if that's just age or... something else?\n",

      "Patient: Oh, um, my temperature? Let me think... I don’t really remember exactly. I think it was, like, normal? Maybe around 98?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that, Cynthia. Could you let me know your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, my heart rate? I'm not sure about the exact number. I think it was... maybe in the 60s? But, you know, I can't really say for sure.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, Cynthia. Could you tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure what that is... I mean, respiratory rate sounds a bit technical, doesn’t it? Maybe it was, like, a little fast? I can’t quite describe it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty, Cynthia. I appreciate it. Could you please tell me your current oxygen saturation level if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, oxygen saturation? I don't really know what that is exactly. I think... maybe it was, like, in the 90s? But honestly, I'm not too sure.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses, Cynthia. Could you please share your blood pressure if you have that information?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, Cynthia. Lastly, could you please provide your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, my weight? I’d rather not say right now. I think it was... around 177 pounds? But, you know, I’m not really focused on that at the moment.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your medications, Cynthia. It sounds like you're on a few important ones. Let's focus on your recovery. Could you tell me if you're taking any diuretics, specifically Furosemide? If so, how often do you take it?\n",

      "Patient: Oh, um, changes in my weight? It’s hard to say. I think I might have lost a little, but, you know, it’s not really something I keep track of closely. I don’t know if that matters much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Cynthia. I appreciate your honesty. Let's focus on your recovery. Can you tell me if you have noticed any changes in your breathing, like if it feels harder at times?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses, Cynthia. I appreciate your willingness to share even if it's difficult at times. Let's focus on your medications again. Have you been able to take your medications as prescribed since your discharge?\n",

      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure if I’d call it shortness of breath. It’s more like... sometimes I feel a little winded, but maybe it’s just me? Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Willie. It’s perfectly okay to feel that way. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don't really remember having that happen. I mean, maybe once or twice, but it wasn't anything too serious, I think?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that. I mean, I’ve been sleeping okay, but, um, I don’t want to say I’ve needed extra pillows or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure, to be honest. Sometimes, I think my legs might feel a bit heavy or something, but it’s hard to say if it's swelling or just, you know, being tired from the day.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that it can be difficult to distinguish those feelings. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure if I’ve got a cough, to be honest. I mean, sometimes I might cough a little, but it’s nothing too serious, I think, so maybe it’s not important?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your input on that. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure I’d call it chest pain, really. Sometimes I feel a little pressure, but it’s hard to say if that's anything to worry about, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Willie. It's important to keep track of any sensations you’re experiencing. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I feel more tired, to be honest. I mean, some days I feel a little off, but it’s hard to say if it’s just, you know, normal stuff or something else.\n",

      "Patient: I don’t remember exactly what my heart rate is. I think it’s, um, probably fine? I mean, I haven't had any issues, so maybe it’s not something we need to focus on.\n",
      "Doctor: That's completely understandable. Could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure what my respiratory rate is, to be honest. I mean, it sounds important, but I don't really understand what that means exactly. Can we skip that for now?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Willie. Let's focus on the vital signs you feel comfortable sharing. Can you tell me your oxygen saturation, if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: I think I might have heard my oxygen saturation was pretty good, maybe around 99? But, um, I don't really remember the exact number. I hope that's okay?\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that your oxygen saturation is around 99%. Can you tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure what my blood pressure is at the moment. I think, um, I heard it was okay, but I don’t want to get too caught up in numbers, you know?\n",

      "I don’t know, maybe a little? I mean, I do have some pillows, but I’m not really sure if it’s because of breathing or just because I like being comfy.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great that you're finding comfort in your pillows. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about that. I mean, sometimes my feet feel a bit off, but I wouldn’t call it swelling. It's hard to say, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint those sensations. Are you experiencing any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I’d rather not discuss that right now. I mean, I feel fine most of the time, so I don’t think it’s important, really.\n",
      "Doctor: That's completely understandable. Let's move on to your vital signs. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what it is right now. I think it was around normal last time I checked, but I can't quite describe this.\n",
      "Doctor: That's okay, it can happen. Let's check your heart rate next. Do you have an idea of what it is?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure, to be honest. I think it’s probably fine, maybe around 70 or something? I mean, that sounds about right, doesn’t it?\n",
      "Doctor: That's a reasonable estimate for your heart rate. How about your respiratory rate? Do you have a recent measurement for that?\n",
      "Patient: I can't quite remember what that was. Is that really necessary to know right now? I mean, I think I’m breathing fine.\n",
      "Doctor: That's perfectly fine; I appreciate your honesty. Let's move on to your oxygen saturation. Do you have a recent reading for that?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the oxygen saturation. I mean, I think it’s probably okay since I feel alright, but I just don’t remember the exact number.\n",
      "Doctor: That's understandable. Let's check your blood pressure next. Do you have a recent reading for that?\n",
      "Patient: I think my blood pressure was, um, something like 140 over… I don’t remember the second number. It's hard to say, but I feel okay most of the time.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Could you please tell me your latest weight?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not quite sure about my weight right now. I mean, I think it was around 205 pounds last time, but I don’t really keep track of that closely. It’s hard to say, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your weight. Now, let's review the medications you are currently taking. Are you on any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking: \n",
      "\n",
      "- ACE inhibitors (e.g., Lisinopril, Enalapril, Ramipril)\n",
      "- Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (e.g., Losartan, Valsartan, Candesartan)\n",
      "- Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., Sacubitril/Valsartan)\n",
      "- Beta-Blockers (e.g., Carvedilol, Metoprolol Succinate, Bisoprolol)\n",
      "- Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone)\n",
      "- Loop diuretics (e.g., Furosemide, Torsemide, Bumetanide)\n",
      "- Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (e.g., Spironolactone, Eplerenone)\n",
      "- Hydralazine\n",
      "- Nitrate medications (e.g., Isosorbide Mononitrate, Isosorbide Dinitrate)\n",
      "- Ivabradine\n",
      "- SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin)\n",
      "- GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Liraglutide, Semaglutide) \n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know what you're taking.\n",
      "Patient: Well, um, I take Lisinopril and Furosemide, for sure. I think there's a couple of other ones, like Metoprolol and Atorvastatin, but I'm not really sure about all the names you mentioned. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know about your medications; it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed with all the names. Just to clarify, you mentioned you're taking Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Metoprolol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can you tell me if you're taking Atorvastatin as well?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that. I think I might be, but I don’t want to get it mixed up with something else. It’s just so many pills, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand how that can feel with so many medications. It's important to keep track of them. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you have a few key medications to manage your heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you further, can you tell me how you've been taking your medications? Have you had any trouble remembering to take them or any side effects?\n",
      "Patient: I don’t really want to talk about that right now. I mean, I think I take them when I’m supposed to, but sometimes I might forget a dose here or there. It’s hard to keep track, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that keeping track of medications can be challenging. If you feel comfortable, could you let me know how you've been managing your medication schedule? Are you using any tools or reminders to help?\n",
      "Patient: I guess I just try to remember, but, um, I don't really have anything special to help me. I mean, sometimes I set alarms on my phone, but it’s not always reliable. It’s hard to say how well that works, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: It's great that you're using alarms on your phone to help with medication reminders. That can be a useful tool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's check in on your recovery a bit more. Have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity or do you feel more tired than usual?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about that, to be honest. I mean, I feel kinda normal, but maybe a bit tired sometimes? It’s hard to describe, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. It's normal to feel a bit tired during recovery, but it's good to keep an eye on how you're feeling overall. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, can you tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: I think I mentioned it earlier, but, um, my weight was around 205 pounds last time I checked. But, you know, I don't really focus on that too much. It’s just a number, right?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Just to clarify, you mentioned earlier that your weight was around 205 pounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can you please share your current heart rate again?\n",
      "Patient: I think I said it was maybe around 70 or something? I’m not exactly sure, but I feel like it’s okay. It’s hard to keep track of all these numbers, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding. Let’s move on to your respiratory rate. Do you have a recent measurement for that?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the respiratory rate. It’s hard to say if I’ve even checked that recently. I mean, I feel fine when I breathe, so I don’t think it’s a big deal, right?\n",
      "Doctor: That's perfectly fine; it's good to hear that you feel fine when you breathe. Could you please tell me your current oxygen saturation if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure what my oxygen saturation is at the moment. I mean, I think it’s probably okay since I feel alright most of the time. But, um, I don't remember the exact number.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let's continue by checking your blood pressure again. Do you have a recent reading for that?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not quite sure about my blood pressure right now. I think it was around 140 over something, but I don’t remember the exact numbers. It’s just hard to keep track of everything, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's check in on your weight again. Do you have a more recent weight measurement since you last mentioned 205 pounds?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I have a more recent weight. I mean, I think it's still around 205 pounds, but I haven’t really checked lately. I don’t see why it’s such a big deal, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let’s focus on your recovery. Can you please tell me if you have experienced any chest pain recently?\n",

      "Doctor: Hello David Vasquez, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Um, hey. I guess I've been okay, maybe? It's hard to say, really. Some days are better than others, I suppose.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, David. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Um, well, I don't know if it's new, but I've felt a bit short of breath sometimes. I can't quite describe this, but it's not really fun, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing shortness of breath, David. Can you tell me if this occurs at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: It's hard to say exactly when it happens. I mean, sometimes it just comes out of nowhere, you know? I'd rather not say too much about it right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate your honesty. Let's address this step by step. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’m not really sure about that. I don’t think I’ve noticed anything like that, but... maybe I just didn’t pay close enough attention?\n",
      "Doctor: That's completely understandable, David. Let’s keep focusing on your symptoms for now. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure if I need to prop myself up, really. It’s just... sometimes I feel a little uncomfortable, but I think it’s okay, maybe?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your feedback, David. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, swelling? I don’t think it’s anything serious. I mean, maybe a little, but I don’t really want to discuss that right now.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, David. Let's shift our focus. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure if I’d call it a cough, honestly. It’s just... sometimes I clear my throat a bit, but I don’t think that’s important right now. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Of course, David. Let's move on. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Um, chest pain? I’m not really sure. I mean, I might have felt something here and there, but it’s probably nothing to worry about, right?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty, David. It’s always good to keep an eye on those feelings, even if they seem minor. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure, to be honest. Maybe I feel a bit more tired sometimes, but it’s hard to tell. I’ve just been trying to keep up with everything, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, David. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature? I think it was, like, around 97 or something? I don't remember exactly, but it seemed normal to me.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, David. Can you tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what my heart rate is right now. Maybe it was in the 80s? I don’t really keep track of that stuff, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, David. Can you please tell me your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure what that means, honestly. I think it might be around 20 or something? But I'm really not good with those numbers.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty, David. Can you tell me your current oxygen saturation level, if you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: Um, oxygen saturation? That sounds important, but I’m not really sure what it is. Maybe it’s around 95 or 96? I think I heard that somewhere, but I don’t know if it’s accurate.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, David. Can you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: Um, blood pressure? I think it was something like, um, 115 over... 60-something? I don’t really remember the exact numbers. It seemed fine, though.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, David. Could you please tell me your current weight?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, David. Let's move on. Have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness lately?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure if I’d call it dizziness, but there have been moments when I felt a bit off. Maybe it was just, um, standing up too fast? It's hard to say if it’s a big deal.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty, David. Have you experienced any issues with your sleep, such as insomnia or waking up frequently during the night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about my sleep, to be honest. Sometimes I wake up, but I can't quite remember if it's often or just a few times. I’d rather not get into that right now, if that’s okay.\n",
      "Doctor: Of course, David. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you experienced any changes in your daily activities or ability to perform tasks you normally do?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure how to answer that. I mean, I still do things, but maybe not as much as before? It's just... things seem a bit harder sometimes, but I don’t want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, David. It's important to recognize any changes, even if they seem small. Can you tell me if you've had any changes in your fluid intake or output, like drinking more or less water than usual?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Jose Ortiz, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, hi there. Um, I guess I’m doing okay? It’s hard to say, really. Just, you know, trying to take it one day at a time.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand; taking it one day at a time is a good approach. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’m not sure what you mean by 'new or worsening symptoms.' I can't quite describe this feeling I have sometimes, but I think it’s probably fine.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Let’s dive a little deeper. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Well, um, yeah, I guess there’s been some shortness of breath. But, like, it's hard to say exactly when it happens. Maybe when I’m just, you know, doing stuff around the house?\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing shortness of breath, especially while doing activities around the house. Have you had any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I’d rather not say about waking up at night. It’s, uh, not really something I want to discuss right now, if that’s okay?\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand, and I appreciate your willingness to share what you're comfortable with. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I don’t think that’s important right now. I mean, it’s possible there’s a little bit of swelling, but I’m not really sure. It’s hard to say.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move forward. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the cough. I mean, I might have coughed a little, but, um, can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Of course, we can move on. Can you tell me if you’ve had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not sure if I’d call it chest pain, really. It’s, um, more like a little discomfort sometimes, but I don’t think it’s anything serious.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I don’t remember exactly about feeling more tired. Maybe a little, but honestly, I’m not sure it’s anything to worry about. Can we, um, talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your input. Let's check on your vital signs. Could you please provide your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Um, let me think... I think it’s, uh, around 98.1? But, you know, I’m not really keeping track of those things all the time.\n",
      "Doctor: That's perfectly fine. Let's keep going. What is your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, heart rate? I think it’s, like, 107 or something? But I don’t really know if that’s good or bad.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What is your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what the respiratory rate is, to be honest. Maybe it’s around 22? But, you know, I’m not really sure how important that is to discuss right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let's move on to your oxygen saturation. Do you have that information?\n",
      "Patient: Um, oxygen saturation? I think it might be around 97? But honestly, I’m not really sure how that affects me day to day. Can we maybe focus on something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your input. What is your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, blood pressure? I think it’s something like 130 over... um, 79? But, you know, I don’t really keep track of that stuff all the time. Is this really necessary?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. What is your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my weight? I think it’s around, like, 151 pounds? But I don't really check that often, you know? It seems, um, kind of unimportant right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your weight. Now, let's review the medications you are currently taking. Are you on any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking. \n",

      "\n",
      "Please let me know what you're currently taking.\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if I want to go through all those medications right now. I mean, I think I'm just taking, um, aspirin? But, uh, I don’t really remember everything else, to be honest. Is that all that important?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that you're taking aspirin. It's important to keep track of all your medications. If you remember any others later, please let me know. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, could you tell me how often you are taking your medications?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure how often I’m taking them. Maybe, um, once a day? But I don’t always keep a close eye on that. I mean, who really counts, right?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. It's understandable that keeping track can be difficult. Let's just check in on your recovery. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\n",
      "Patient: I’m not really sure about my appetite. It’s, um, kind of the same, I guess? Maybe a little less, but, you know, it’s hard to say. As for my weight, well, I think I mentioned it’s around 151 pounds, but I don’t really pay that much attention to it.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty. Let's focus on your recovery. Can you tell me if you've experienced any changes in your sleep patterns lately?\n",
      "Patient: Um, sleep patterns? I don’t know, it’s hard to say. Maybe it’s the same as before? I mean, I sometimes have trouble sleeping, but I'm not really sure if it’s related to anything specific. \n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's important to be aware of any changes in your sleep. Now, let’s return to your vital signs. What is your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, my temperature? I think I mentioned it before, but, let me think... it’s around 98.1? I hope that’s okay?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for confirming your temperature. Let's check in on your heart rate again; could you provide that for me?\n",
      "Patient: Um, heart rate again? I think it’s, like, 107? But, you know, I’m not really sure how important it is to keep repeating that. \n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your honesty. Let's check your respiratory rate. What is your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure I can remember the respiratory rate right now. Maybe it’s around 22? But, um, I don’t really think it matters much, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your responses. Let's continue checking your vital signs. What is your current oxygen saturation?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure about the oxygen saturation right now. I think it might be, um, 97? But, you know, I don't really understand how that affects me. Can we talk about something else?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. What is your current blood pressure?\n",

      "Patient: Um, my weight? I think it’s around, like, 151 pounds? But, um, I don’t really check it that often, you know? It seems, like, not that important right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let's check in on your overall condition. Can you tell me how often you feel the need to take breaks during daily activities?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure how often I take breaks. I mean, it varies, I guess? Sometimes I feel like I need to rest more, but, uh, I don’t really keep track of that. Is that important?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness recently?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Anna. Can you tell me if you've noticed any new or worsening symptoms since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I don’t want to discuss that right now. I mean, maybe just a little more tired than usual, but it’s not, like, a big deal or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Anna. Fatigue can be quite common during recovery. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I can't quite describe this. I mean, sometimes I feel a bit out of breath, but it could just be, you know, normal stuff? Like getting older or whatever.\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty, Anna. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what you’re asking. I mean, I sleep okay, mostly, but I don’t really want to get into all that right now.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying, Anna. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure if that's really necessary to discuss. I mean, I think I’m managing okay, maybe just a little extra cushion sometimes, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Anna. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I’d rather not say about the swelling. I mean, sometimes my feet feel a bit tight, but I think it’s just because I’ve been sitting a lot, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Anna. It's good to hear you're managing. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by that. I mean, sometimes I cough a bit, but it’s probably just, um, something in the air or allergies, right?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying, Anna. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I don’t think that’s important right now. I mean, I feel fine most of the time, just the usual aches and stuff, you know?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for your response, Anna. Could you let me know your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by respiratory rate. It sounds, um, a bit technical. I think they said it was fine when I was in the hospital, though?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding, Anna. Can you please provide your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, um, I’m not really sure about that number. I think it was good, like, maybe around what it should be? But I don’t really know the specifics.\n",
