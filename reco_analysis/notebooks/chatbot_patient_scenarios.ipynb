      "Doctor: I appreciate your efforts in providing information, Michael. Let's focus on your symptoms. Have you been experiencing any nocturnal cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, nocturnal cough... I'm not entirely certain about that. It's hard to say if it's happening at night. Maybe... there could be some coughing, but I can't recall exactly. My memory can be a bit fuzzy on these details.\n",
      "Doctor: Based on our discussion, let's move on to another symptom. Can you tell me if you have experienced any shortness of breath at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not certain about the shortness of breath... It's hard to say when it happens. Maybe it's when I... walk a bit? Let me think about it.\n",
      "Doctor: Based on our discussion, let's focus on another symptom. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night, a symptom called paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",
      "Patient: I'm sorry, but I think I've shared enough for today. I'm feeling a bit tired and would like to rest now. Thank you for checking in on me.\n"
