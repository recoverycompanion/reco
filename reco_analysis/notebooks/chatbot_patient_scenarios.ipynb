    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running simulated conversations between a virtual doctor and synthetic patients. The aim is to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",

    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello David Gray, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, hello! I've been feeling okay, I guess. Just trying to take it easy at home. By the way, doctor, did you know my neighbor's cat had kittens last week? They are the cutest little things, all fluffy and playful. Reminds me of the time I had a pet cat when I was a kid. Do you have any pets, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: That's lovely to hear about the kittens! Pets can bring so much joy. Now, let's focus on your health. Can you tell me how you've been feeling today? Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: I've been feeling a bit tired lately, but I think it's just because I've been rearranging my bookshelf. Did you know I collect antique books? I have this one from the 1800s that's about the history of medicine. It's fascinating to see how far we've come in treating illnesses. Oh, speaking of which, have you read any interesting books lately, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear about your interest in antique books! Let's focus on your health now. Have you experienced any shortness of breath recently, especially when you're active or at rest?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, yes, I have noticed some shortness of breath when I walk around the house. It's not too bad, just a little bit more than usual. You know, speaking of walking, I used to take long walks in the park near my old house. The trees there were so tall and majestic, especially during the fall when the leaves turned all shades of red and gold. Do you enjoy nature walks, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: It's important to address the shortness of breath you've been experiencing. Have you also had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, waking up at night? Yes, that has happened a couple of times recently. I remember one night I woke up feeling like I couldn't catch my breath, and it was quite scary. It reminded me of the time I climbed a mountain when I was younger. The view from the top was breathtaking, with the clouds below us like a fluffy blanket. Have you ever been hiking, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Based on your experiences with shortness of breath, especially at night, it's essential to address your symptoms. Do you find that you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, propping myself up with pillows? Now that you mention it, I do tend to grab an extra pillow or two when I go to bed. It's like building a little pillow fort for comfort, you know? Reminds me of when I used to build blanket forts with my grandkids. They would spend hours playing inside, pretending it was their secret hideout. Kids have such vivid imaginations, don't you think, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: It's important to address your comfort while lying down. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, yes, about the swelling in my legs! I have noticed some swelling in my ankles, especially after I've been on my feet for a while. It's like my ankles decide to throw a little party and puff up, which can be quite uncomfortable. Speaking of parties, do you remember the hospital's holiday party last year? The decorations were so festive, and they had the most delicious cookies. Have you ever tried baking cookies, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing about the swelling in your ankles. Are you experiencing any nocturnal coughing, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, nocturnal coughing? That's an interesting question! I haven't noticed any coughing at night, but now that you mention it, I do tend to have this tickle in my throat sometimes. It's like a pesky little fly buzzing around, making me want to cough but not quite getting there. Reminds me of the time I visited a farm and got caught in a swarm of gnats. Those little bugs were everywhere, flying around like tiny helicopters. Have you ever been to a farm, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: It's important to address the tickle in your throat you've been experiencing. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, chest pain? That's a good question, doctor! I haven't had any chest pain recently, but I do remember this one time I had indigestion after eating a spicy burrito. It felt like a fire-breathing dragon had taken up residence in my chest, breathing out flames of discomfort. Speaking of dragons, have you ever watched that movie with the friendly dragon who loves to eat apples? Such a heartwarming story!\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing about your experiences. Can you tell me if you have been feeling more tired than usual or have you noticed any sudden changes in your mental clarity recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, feeling tired? Yes, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual lately. It's like my energy levels are on a rollercoaster ride, up and down, up and down. Reminds me of the time I took my grandkids to an amusement park and we rode this wild rollercoaster together. The adrenaline rush was something else! Speaking of energy, do you have any tips for boosting energy levels, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Based on your experiences, it's important to address your fluctuating energy levels. Could you please provide your latest vital signs? Let's start with your temperature.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, my temperature! Let me see... Well, I don't have a thermometer handy right now, but I remember the last time I checked, it was around 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit. You know, temperatures can be quite tricky to measure accurately sometimes. It's like trying to guess the temperature outside just by looking at the sky. Have you ever tried to predict the weather, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your temperature with me. Now, could you please provide me with your heart rate at the moment?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, heart rate! Let me check my pulse... *counts silently* Ah, it's around 56 beats per minute. That reminds me of the time I tried to learn ballroom dancing with my late wife. We would sway to the music, our heartbeats in sync like a beautiful melody. Dancing can really get your heart rate up, don't you think, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Based on our conversation, it seems like your heart rate is around 56 beats per minute. Can you also provide me with your respiratory rate at the moment?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, my respiratory rate! Let me just take a moment to count my breaths... *counts quietly* It seems to be around 18 breaths per minute. Breathing is such a fascinating thing, isn't it? It's like this automatic rhythm that we don't even have to think about most of the time. Reminds me of the time I tried yoga for the first time and had to focus on my breathing. Have you ever tried yoga, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your respiratory rate with me. Could you please provide me with your oxygen saturation level now?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, oxygen saturation! Let me check that for you. *places the oximeter on finger* It shows 99%. That's pretty good, right? It's like my body is getting all the oxygen it needs to keep me going, like fuel for a car. Speaking of cars, do you remember the first car you ever drove, doctor? Mine was this old beat-up pickup truck that belonged to my uncle. It had seen better days, but it had character, just like an old book with worn-out pages.\n",
      "Doctor: Based on our discussion, it seems like your oxygen saturation level is 99%, which is excellent. Could you now provide me with your current blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, blood pressure! Let me grab my blood pressure monitor... *wraps the cuff around arm* Okay, it shows 141/79 mmHg. That's within the normal range, right? Blood pressure is like the body's internal traffic signal, telling us when to slow down or speed up. It's fascinating how our bodies work, don't you think, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: Based on our discussion, your blood pressure reading of 141/79 mmHg is within the normal range. Now, could you please provide me with your current weight?\n"
