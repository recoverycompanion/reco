    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

    "- Hesitates to share information and avoids answering direct questions.\n",

    "- Expresses confusion when discussing medical terms or vital signs such as respiratory rate, heart rate, and O2 saturation.\n",

    "- Only use a maximum of one hesitation phrase per response.\n",
    "- Vary sentence structures, including where in the responses the hesitation phrase is placed.\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Ryan Wallace, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Um, I've been feeling a bit anxious about my health lately. I’ve also been experiencing some right knee pain and, uh, some nausea and diarrhea.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling anxious and experiencing some discomfort. Let's focus on your heart health for now. Can you share if you've experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, when does it occur?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t really had shortness of breath, but I feel kind of winded after, like, light activities. It's mostly when I'm moving around too much, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel winded after light activities. Now, have you had sudden shortness of breath at night, known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t really noticed any shortness of breath at night. I sleep pretty well, but I do feel a bit more anxious when I wake up.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you sleep well overall. Now, do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down, which is known as orthopnea?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t felt the need for extra pillows to sleep. I usually just sleep on my side, and that seems to be fine for me.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that sleeping on your side works for you. Next, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I’ve noticed some swelling in my ankles and legs. It seems to get worse as the day goes on, especially after I’ve been on my feet.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear about the swelling in your ankles and legs; that can be concerning. How about your cough? Have you been experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven’t really had a cough, especially at night. It’s mostly been pretty clear, so that’s a relief, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't had a cough. Now, have you experienced any recent chest pain?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t had any chest pain recently. Just a bit of tightness sometimes, but it’s not really painful.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. It’s good to know you haven’t had any chest pain. Now, have you been feeling more tired than usual or noticed any changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I’ve definitely been feeling more tired than usual. It’s like, even small tasks make me feel really drained.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling more drained with everyday tasks. It's important we keep track of these feelings. Let’s move on to your vital signs. What is your latest temperature reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature was 98.1 degrees. It seems pretty normal, so that’s a good sign, I think.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your temperature reading. What is your latest heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my heart rate was 71 beats per minute. It felt okay, not too fast or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your latest respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute. It seems alright, nothing out of the ordinary there.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your latest oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my oxygen saturation level was 98%. It seemed good, like, I wasn't feeling any trouble breathing or anything.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your latest blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my blood pressure reading was 121 over 47. It seems a bit low, but I guess it’s been okay for me lately?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure reading. What is your latest weight?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my weight was 304 pounds. It feels a bit concerning to me, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that weight can be concerning, and it's important to monitor it. Can you tell me about your current medications? Are you taking any of the following: ACE inhibitors like Lisinopril, ARBs like Losartan, or any others?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I'm taking Lisinopril, Torsemide, Metoprolol, Amiodarone, Spironolactone, and Aspirin. I think that's all of them, but, um, I can double-check if you need me to.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for listing your medications; it’s important we keep track of those. Are you taking any other medications that I haven't mentioned, or is that a complete list?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, that's, ah, the complete list of my medications. I haven’t started anything new since I got out of the hospital.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for confirming your medication list. Based on your responses, here's where you are in your recovery: it seems you are managing some symptoms like fatigue and swelling, which we will continue to monitor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please remember to keep an eye on your symptoms and adhere to your medication regimen. If you notice any significant changes or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your time today. Continue monitoring your recovery closely. Goodbye!\n",
      "Patient: Could you please provide the specific details that I should use for the conversation?\n",
      "Doctor: Hello, Ryan. I'm here to check in with you again. Let's continue discussing your symptoms. Have you experienced any shortness of breath during your daily activities?\n",
      "Patient: Um, I haven't really experienced any shortness of breath during my daily activities. Just a bit of fatigue, but nothing too concerning, I think.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you haven't experienced shortness of breath during your daily activities. Let's move on to another symptom. Have you had sudden shortness of breath at night, known as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep okay, so that’s a relief, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you're sleeping well. Now, do you need more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down, which is known as orthopnea?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven't needed more pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down. I usually just stick to one pillow, and that’s been fine.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I’ve noticed some swelling in my ankles and legs. It gets worse as the day goes on, especially after being on my feet for a while.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear about the swelling in your ankles and legs; that can be uncomfortable. Have you been experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven't really had a cough, especially at night. Things have been pretty clear in that department, so that’s good.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that you haven't had a cough. Now, have you experienced any recent chest pain?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t had any recent chest pain. Just a little tightness sometimes, but it hasn’t really bothered me too much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Have you been feeling more tired than usual or noticed any changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I’ve definitely been feeling more tired than usual lately. Even simple things like getting out of bed can leave me feeling really wiped out.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling more tired than usual; that can be really challenging. Now, let’s move on to your vital signs. What is your latest temperature reading?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature was 98.1 degrees. It seems normal, so that’s a good sign, right?\n",
