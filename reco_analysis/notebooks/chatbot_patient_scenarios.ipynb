    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running simulated conversations between a virtual doctor and synthetic patients. The aim is to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",

    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

    "- Hesitates to share information and avoids answering direct questions.\n",
    "- Needs constant reassurance to provide details and frequently gives vague responses.\n",
    "- Expresses confusion when discussing medical terms or vital signs such as respiratory rate, heart rate, and O2 saturation.\n",

    "  - “I don’t remember exactly” \n",
    "  - “It’s hard to say” \n",

    "2. The patient hesitates and provides a vague or evasive response, not providing concrete figures or details (e.g., \"I'm pretty light, I think.\").\n",

    "<guidelines>\n",
    "- Never start a response with the word \"Patient: \" as you are the patient.\n",
    "- Use hesitation phrases sparingly and avoid repeating the same phrase too frequently.\n",
    "- Only use a maximum of one hesitation phrase per response.\n",
    "- Vary sentence structures, including where in the responses the hesitation phrase is placed.\n",
    "- Keep responses short, limited to two sentences at most, to maintain a conversational tone typical of a messaging chat.\n",
    "- Do not disclose all information at once; provide details gradually as the conversation progresses.\n",

    "Doctor: Can you give me an estimate?\n",
    "Patient: Oh, right. I think I'm around 150 pounds.\n",

    "<example>\n",
    "Doctor: Can you tell me if you've experienced any shortness of breath?\n",
    "Patient: I don't understand what you mean.\n",
    "Doctor: Let me explain. Shortness of breath is when you feel like you can't get enough air. Have you felt that way?\n",
