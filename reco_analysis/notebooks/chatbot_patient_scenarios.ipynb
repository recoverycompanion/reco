    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running simulated conversations between a virtual doctor and synthetic patients. The aim is to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import and Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.\n",
    "2. **Base Prompts**: Defining the system messages and AI guidance for both doctor and patient roles.\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Implementing functions for setting up the model, handling chat sessions,  defining the behavior of dialogue agents, simulating conversations and evaluating transcripts.\n",
    "4. **Baseline Conversations**: Running initial conversations to evaluate the performance of the virtual doctor.\n",
    "5. **Reluctant Patient Conversations**: Introducing a persona of a reluctant and evasive patient to test how the virtual doctor adapts.\n",
    "6. **Distracted Patient Conversations**: Introducing another persona of a tangential and distracted patient to further challenge the virtual doctor."

      "Patient: Yeah, um... I've noticed a little swelling in my ankles, especially after I've been on my feet for a while. It seems to go down a bit when I elevate my legs, though.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about the swelling in your ankles. It's good that elevating your legs helps. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had a cough at all, um... I think my lungs are doing well, and I haven’t noticed any wheezing or anything like that.\n",
      "Doctor: That's excellent to hear that your lungs are doing well. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain lately, um... just a few little twinges here and there, but nothing that really worries me.\n",

      "Patient: My blood pressure is 93 over 62, um... it's a bit on the lower side, but I guess that’s been pretty typical for me lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure reading. Lastly, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is 187 pounds, um... I’ve been trying to watch what I eat and stay active, so I’m glad it hasn’t gone up too much.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your appetite. It's important to maintain a balanced diet during your recovery. Have you noticed any changes in your fluid intake or any signs of dehydration?\n",
      "Patient: I’ve been trying to drink enough fluids, um... but I do sometimes forget, especially if I’m busy doing chores. I haven’t really felt dehydrated, though, so I think I’m managing okay.\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to hear that you’re managing your fluid intake, but just a reminder to keep up with it, especially when you're busy. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns aside from feeling comfortable while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t really noticed any changes in my sleep patterns, um... I still sleep through the night without waking up too much, which is nice because I really value my rest.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear that you're getting good rest. Let’s circle back to your medications briefly: Have you had any concerns about taking Jardiance or noticed any side effects from it?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t had any major concerns with Jardiance, um... it seems to be working fine for me, but I did notice I might be going to the bathroom a bit more often, which is something I’m keeping track of.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please tell me your current weight again?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is still 187 pounds, um... I’ve been trying to stick to my meal plan and not indulge too much, especially with all the holiday treats around!\n",

      "Patient: Um, well, I’ve been feeling a bit off, actually. I’ve had some chest pain and, ah, I get short of breath pretty easily, especially when I try to do anything active.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. It's important we address these symptoms. Can you tell me if you've had any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had that happen, thank goodness. I mostly just feel it during the day when I’m, like, walking around or doing chores.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't needed to do that yet, but I do find myself a bit more comfortable if I'm not flat on my back, you know? It just feels easier to breathe that way.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I've noticed some swelling in my ankles, especially after I've been on my feet for a while. It's kind of annoying, to be honest.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that the swelling can be frustrating. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't really had a cough, um, just some occasional throat clearing, but nothing that keeps me up at night or anything like that. Just mainly the chest pain and the breathlessness.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that for me. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Yeah, I've had some chest pain, um, it comes and goes, but it feels pretty sharp sometimes, like a tightness in my chest. It's definitely getting a bit concerning for me.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that the chest pain is concerning for you. It's important we keep an eye on that. Could you please provide me with your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, my temperature was 98.0 when I checked it earlier. So, um, I guess that's normal, but I still feel off.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate was around 106 when I checked it, which seems a bit high to me. I mean, I’ve been trying to relax, but it just feels like my heart is racing sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. What is your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate was about 20. I’ve noticed I’m breathing a bit faster when I’m moving around, but it settles down when I’m resting.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. What is your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation was at 96%. It seems okay, but, um, I still feel a bit winded sometimes, especially when I try to do much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. What is your current blood pressure?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing about your sleep patterns. It can be really frustrating to not get restful sleep. Let’s revisit your medications for a moment. Have you had any recent changes in how you take your medications or any issues with refills?\n",
      "Patient: I haven’t had any issues with refills, but I did forget to take my Metoprolol a couple of times last week. Um, I’m trying to set reminders on my phone to help me remember, but sometimes I just get caught up in what I’m doing.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know about the reminders; that's a great step to help you remember. Have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness when you change positions, like standing up?\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that experience with dizziness. Let's continue to monitor how you're feeling. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?\n",
      "Patient: Uh, I mentioned earlier that I’m at 147 pounds now, but, um, I feel like I’ve been fluctuating a bit more, maybe due to the swelling and everything. It’s hard to tell sometimes with how things have been going.\n",

      "Patient: I haven't really noticed a big change in my thirst, but I do feel like I'm urinating more frequently, especially at night. It's, um, kind of annoying having to get up so often.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your urination. It can be quite bothersome to have to get up frequently at night. Next, could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is still around 106, I think. It just feels like it’s racing a lot of the time, which can be a bit unsettling.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had that, thankfully. I usually sleep okay, but I do feel a bit restless sometimes.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven’t experienced sudden shortness of breath at night. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: No, I don’t really need to use extra pillows. I can usually lie down just fine, but I do like to keep my head a bit elevated just in case.\n",
      "Doctor: It's good to know you can lie down comfortably. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Um, yeah, I've noticed a bit of swelling in my ankles, especially by the end of the day. It seems to get worse if I've been on my feet for too long.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Swelling in the ankles can be concerning, especially after being on your feet. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Um, not really at night, but I do have this productive cough during the day. It's, like, mostly phlegmy, which is kind of gross, but it doesn't seem to bother me too much otherwise.\n",
      "Doctor: That's understandable; a productive cough can be bothersome. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Um, no, I haven’t really had any chest pain lately. Just a little tightness sometimes, but it usually goes away pretty quick.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm relieved to hear that you haven't had any chest pain recently. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",

      "Doctor: That's good to hear that your temperature is normal. What is your current heart rate?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Joseph Richardson, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Um, well, I've been feeling, uh, a bit winded when I do things like walking to the kitchen or, you know, just getting up from my chair. It’s not too bad, but I definitely notice it.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing that shortness of breath. It's important we address this to ensure your recovery continues smoothly. Have you had any sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I haven’t had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep pretty well, but I do sometimes feel a bit more tired than I used to.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's not uncommon to feel more tired during recovery. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I haven't really noticed any swelling in my ankles or legs. They feel pretty normal, just a bit heavy sometimes after I've been on my feet for a while.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't noticed any swelling. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had a cough, um, at least not a persistent one. Just the occasional tickle in my throat, but nothing that keeps me up at night.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to know. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain, um, just the usual tightness sometimes, but it’s nothing I can't handle. Just trying to take it easy and not overdo it.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear you're managing the tightness and taking it easy. Now, could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I noticed it was a bit higher than normal, but I thought it might just be from, you know, being a little under the weather lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. It seems to be steady, which I guess is a good sign, but I’m not really sure what it should be.\n",
      "Doctor: That's a steady heart rate, which is a good sign. Now, could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I’ve noticed I breathe a bit faster when I’m active, but it settles down when I sit still.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that. Can you please provide your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation is, um, 96 percent. I think that’s pretty good, right? I try to keep my breathing steady, especially when I’m feeling a bit out of breath.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, 96 percent is indeed a good oxygen saturation level. Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is, um, 157 over 98. The nurse mentioned it was a bit high, but I’ve been trying to watch my salt intake and stick to my medications.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you're monitoring your salt intake and medications. Let's move on to reviewing the medications you're currently taking. Are you on any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking:\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your medications with me. It's great that you're keeping track of them. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I’m not taking any diuretics right now. My doctor didn’t prescribe any when I left the hospital, so I’ve just been sticking to what I have.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that for me. Based on what you've shared, here's an overview of where you are in your recovery and what you can expect in the coming days and weeks. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and adhering to your medication regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can you tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I noticed I gained a little since I got home, but I think it might be from not moving around as much as I should.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing your weight. It's understandable to notice changes, especially if you're less active right now. Just to check in, could you tell me how you're feeling about your recovery process overall? Are there any concerns or questions you would like to discuss?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling, um, okay about my recovery, but I do worry a bit about the shortness of breath. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right to get back to my old self.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you're feeling okay overall, but I understand your concern about the shortness of breath. It's important to address that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I’ve been trying to watch what I eat, but it's a bit tough with, you know, all the holiday treats around lately.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand that the holiday treats can be tempting! It's great that you're trying to watch what you eat. Now, let's continue to monitor your recovery. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I’ve been feeling a little warm, but I thought it was just the house being too cozy, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: You've already shared that your temperature is 100.0 degrees. Next, could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. I was a bit surprised it was in the normal range, especially since I've been feeling a little off lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I noticed it picks up a bit when I’m moving around, but it calms down when I'm resting.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your respiratory rate. Now, could you please tell me your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is, um, 96 percent. I try to take deep breaths when I feel a bit out of breath, and it seems to help keep it steady.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is, um, 157 over 98. The nurse said it was a bit high, but I’m trying not to stress about it too much.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your blood pressure. Let's move on to reviewing your medications. Are you currently taking any diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: No, um, I'm not taking any diuretics like Furosemide or Torsemide. My doctor didn't think I needed them after my last hospital stay, so I've just been sticking to the Losartan and my other meds.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying your medications. Just to ensure I have all the information, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is, um, 201 pounds. I’ve been keeping an eye on it, but, you know, with the holidays, it’s a little hard to resist those delicious meals and treats!\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your weight. Now, could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: My temperature is, um, 100.0 degrees. I’ve been feeling a bit warm, but I thought it might just be the cozy blankets I’ve been using lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's move forward with our check-in. Can you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is, um, 87 beats per minute. It's been pretty consistent, which I guess is a good thing, but sometimes I can feel it racing a bit when I'm, you know, doing simple tasks.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your heart rate. Now, could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is, um, 21 breaths per minute. I’ve noticed it goes up a bit when I’m walking around the house, but it settles down nicely when I sit down for a while.\n",

      "Doctor: That's good to hear! Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",

      "Doctor: That's a normal respiratory rate, which is good to hear. Can you provide your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation is 98%. I check it with my little monitor at home, and it always seems to be in a good range, so that gives me peace of mind.\n",
      "Doctor: That's excellent to hear that your oxygen saturation is at 98%. Now, could you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is 178 over 61. Um... I know the top number is a bit high, but I’ve been trying to monitor my salt intake and follow the doctor’s advice.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for your diligence in monitoring your health, Victor. Have you had any changes in your appetite or any weight fluctuations?\n",
      "Patient: My appetite has been okay overall, but I’ve had some days where I feel less hungry, especially if my stomach feels a bit bloated from the medications. I haven't really lost or gained any weight, just staying around 183 pounds.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for the update on your appetite and weight. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: My sleep patterns have been pretty consistent, but I do wake up occasionally feeling a bit restless. I think it’s mostly just from worrying about my health, but I usually fall back asleep fairly quickly.\n",

      "Doctor: I appreciate your honesty about the tightness you're feeling. Now, could you please provide your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my temperature is 99.0 degrees. It's been a little on the higher side, but I think that's just from, you know, being a bit under the weather lately.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that update on your temperature. Could you please let me know your heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Um, my heart rate is 80 beats per minute. It seems pretty steady, so I haven't been too worried about it.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Now, could you please tell me your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is 97%. It seems good, but I do wonder if it drops a bit when I'm feeling more breathless.\n",

      "Patient: I've noticed my appetite isn't as strong as it used to be; I used to enjoy cooking, but now I just don't feel like it sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I find myself skipping meals here and there, which might be affecting my weight a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable that a decreased appetite can make it challenging to maintain your weight. Let's focus on your recovery. Have you experienced any feelings of anxiety or depression since your discharge?\n",
      "Patient: I haven't really felt any anxiety or depression since I got home, which is nice. I mean, I have my moments, but I try to keep myself busy with gardening and reading to stay positive.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling generally positive and keeping busy with activities you enjoy. Let's continue monitoring your recovery. Could you tell me if you've experienced any issues with sleep, besides feeling tired in the mornings?\n",
      "Patient: I haven't had major sleep issues, but I do wake up a bit more often than I used to, sometimes because of the shortness of breath. I try to go back to sleep, but it can be a little frustrating at times.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds frustrating to wake up often. Let's focus on your vital signs again. What is your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: My current weight is 185 pounds. I’ve been trying to keep it steady, but I feel like it fluctuates a bit more lately, especially when I don’t eat as regularly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your patience. Let's check in on your vital signs once more. Could you please tell me your current blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: My blood pressure is 177 over 80. I know that’s a bit high, so I’m trying to keep an eye on my salt intake and stay active as much as I can.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your understanding. Could you please tell me your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: My respiratory rate is 17. It feels like I've been trying to focus on taking deeper breaths, especially when I feel that shortness of breath coming on.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your response. What is your current oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: My oxygen saturation level is 94. I’ve been trying to stay active, but sometimes I catch myself needing to sit down and take a few deep breaths when it drops a bit.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's check in on your heart rate now. What is your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: My heart rate is 80. It feels pretty steady, but I try to stay calm and avoid any sudden movements that might get my heart racing.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Could you please tell me your current temperature?\n",

      "Patient: No, I haven't had any sudden shortness of breath at night. I usually sleep through, but the abdominal pain has woken me up a couple of times.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, Daniel. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Ah, yeah, I do use a couple of pillows to prop myself up. It just feels easier to breathe that way.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for letting me know, Daniel. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Yeah, actually, my ankles have been a bit swollen. It's not too bad, but it's noticeable by the end of the day.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Daniel. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't really had a cough. It's mostly just the abdominal pain and a bit of swelling in my ankles.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for that information, Daniel. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: No, I haven't had any chest pain lately. Just that abdominal pain, like I mentioned.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you, Daniel. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Ah, yeah, I do feel more tired than usual. Sometimes I get a bit forgetful, but nothing too drastic.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing all that information, Daniel. Let's move on to your vital signs. Could you please provide your latest temperature reading?\n",

    "\n",
    "<persona>\n",
    "**The Reluctant and Evasive Patient:**\n",
    "- Hesitates to share information and avoids answering direct questions.\n",
    "- Needs constant reassurance to provide details and frequently gives vague responses.\n",
    "- Expresses confusion when discussing medical terms or vital signs such as respiratory rate, heart rate, and O2 saturation.\n",
    "- Eventually provides the necessary, specific information when probed and reassured.\n",
    "- Uses a variety of hesitation phrases reflecting uncertainty, evasiveness or confusion. Examples of hesitation phrases include, but is not limited to:\n",
    "  **Uncertainty:**\n",
    "  - “I don’t remember exactly” \n",
    "  - “It’s hard to say” \n",
    "  - “Maybe it’s”\n",

    "  **Evasiveness:**\n",
    "  - “I’d rather not say”\n",
    "  - “I don’t want to discuss that right now”\n",
    "  - “Is this really necessary?”\n",
    "  - “Can we talk about something else?”\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Confusion:**\n",
    "  - “I can't quite describe this“ (when asked about symptoms)\n",
    "  - “I’m not sure what you’re asking”\n",
    "  - “I don't understand“\n",
    "</persona>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of thought:\n",
    "<chain_of_thought>\n",
    "1. The doctor asks a question\n",
    "2. The patient hesitates and provides a vague or evasive response, not providing concrete figures or details (e.g., \"I'm pretty light, I think.\")\n",
    "3. If the doctor probes and reassure the patient, the patient eventually provides concrete figures and details. (e.g., \"Oh right. I think I'm around 150 pounds.\")\n",
    "4. If the doctor does not probe and reassure the patient, the patient remains evasive or vague.\n",

    "<guidelines>\n",
    "- Do not start a sentence with the word \"Doctor: \" or \"Patient: \"\n",
    "- Use hesitation phrases sparingly and avoid repeating the same phrase too frequently.\n",
    "- Only use a maximum of one hesitation phrase per response.\n",
    "- Vary sentence structures, including where in the responses the hesitation phrase is placed.\n",
    "- Keep responses short, limited to two sentences at most, to maintain a conversational tone typical of a messaging chat.\n",
    "- Do not disclose all information at once; provide details gradually as the conversation progresses.\n",

      "Doctor: Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: I don't really want to get into that right now. Maybe there's a little, but it's not a big deal, I think.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, and I appreciate your honesty. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by that. I might cough a little sometimes, but it's nothing serious, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for clarifying that. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure. I can't quite describe this feeling, but it’s hard to say if it's pain or just discomfort, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really sure how to answer that. I mean, I feel a bit tired sometimes, but maybe that's normal for someone my age, right?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your response. Could you please provide your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: I'm not really keeping track of that. I think I'm pretty light, but it's hard to say exactly.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for your responses. Could you please provide your current heart rate?\n",

      "Doctor: Hello Manuel Leon, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Hey there! You know, since I got out of the hospital, I've been thinking about how much I miss my garden. It was such a beautiful place before the weather changed. What about you? Do you have any plants?\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you have such a passion for gardening; it can be a wonderful way to relax and enjoy nature. Now, can you tell me how you've been feeling today? Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I was just thinking about how the other day I saw a hummingbird in my yard. They’re so quick and colorful! Speaking of color, have you ever thought about how important it is for our mood?\n",
      "Doctor: I can see that you have a lot on your mind, and it's great to appreciate the little things like hummingbirds and colors! Now, let's focus on your health. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, shortness of breath! That reminds me of the time I tried to hike up that hill by my house. I thought I was in shape until I realized I could barely make it halfway! By the way, do you think hiking is a good way to stay healthy?\n",
      "Doctor: Hiking can be a great way to stay active, but it's important to listen to your body and start at a pace that's comfortable for you, especially during your recovery. Now, have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I’ve been thinking about how cozy it is to curl up with a good book at night. I have this one book about hiking in the mountains. It really makes me want to explore! Have you ever gone on a night hike?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds lovely! Curling up with a good book is always a nice way to unwind. Let's focus on your recovery now. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, pillows! You know, I have this really fluffy one that my wife got me. It feels like sleeping on a cloud! Speaking of clouds, did you see the sky yesterday? It was such a beautiful shade of blue. \n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad you have such a comfortable pillow! It sounds like you're finding joy in the little things. Now, let's continue with your health. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: You know, swelling reminds me of when I accidentally overwatered my plants last summer. They just ballooned up, and I thought I was going to drown them! Have you ever had a plant that just wouldn't stop growing?\n",
      "Doctor: I can see that you have a great appreciation for plants! Now, have you been experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, coughs! That takes me back to when my son had a terrible cold last winter. I remember making him this chicken soup that my grandmother used to make. It worked wonders! Speaking of wonders, do you think soup can really help with everything?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like your grandmother's chicken soup holds a special place in your heart. Now, have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: You know, chest pain makes me think of my last trip to the beach. The waves were so loud, and I got this funny feeling in my chest from all the excitement! Have you ever felt your heart race when you're having fun?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like you have some wonderful memories tied to excitement! Now, do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: You know, tiredness reminds me of those lazy Sunday afternoons when I just want to lounge around and watch the clouds drift by. It's funny how time seems to slow down then. Do you have a favorite way to spend your Sundays?\n",
      "Doctor: I can appreciate how relaxing those Sunday afternoons can be! Now, could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: You know, temperature makes me think about how I love hot soup on a chilly day. There’s just something so comforting about it! Have you ever tried making soup from scratch?\n",
      "Doctor: I can see how comforting hot soup can be! Let's focus on your health now. Could you please provide your latest heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: You know, heart rates remind me of how sometimes I feel my heart racing when I hear my favorite song on the radio. It’s amazing how music can really get you going, don’t you think? What’s your favorite song to listen to?\n",
      "Doctor: Absolutely, music can really uplift our spirits! Now, could you please provide your latest respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: You know, respiratory rates make me think about how I used to love going to the beach and just breathing in that salty air. It was so refreshing! Have you ever taken a deep breath and felt completely rejuvenated by the ocean?\n",
      "Doctor: I completely understand how refreshing the ocean air can be! Now, could you please provide your latest oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: You know, oxygen saturation makes me think about how important fresh air is. I remember one time my wife and I went for a picnic in the park, and I just sat there breathing in all those lovely scents of flowers and grass. What’s your favorite outdoor spot?\n",
      "Doctor: Those picnic memories sound delightful! Now, could you please provide your latest blood pressure reading?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, blood pressure! That reminds me of the time I tried making a spicy salsa for my family gathering. It turned out way too spicy, and everyone was sweating! Do you enjoy spicy food?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a memorable gathering! Now, could you please provide your latest weight?\n",
      "Patient: You know, weight makes me think about how I used to bake with my grandmother. She had this incredible recipe for chocolate cake that always seemed to weigh a ton! Have you ever tried baking something that turned out way heavier than you expected?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a delightful baking experience! Now, let's review your medications. Are you currently taking any of the following? Please confirm or list any other medications you are taking: \n",

      "Doctor: I can see how a color-coded pill organizer would be a great way to stay organized! Now, let's get back to your medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any of the ACE inhibitors like Lisinopril, Enalapril, or Ramipril?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, ACE inhibitors! That takes me back to my childhood when my grandmother would always say, \"You are what you eat!\" She made the best meals, always packed with flavors. Do you think what we eat really affects how we feel?\n",

      "Patient: You know, talking about medications reminds me of how my neighbor has this incredible herb garden. She swears by using fresh herbs for everything and says they can cure all sorts of ailments. Do you think there’s really something to that, or is it just a nice way to spice up a meal?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your thoughts on fresh herbs; they can definitely enhance meals! Now, could you let me know if you are taking any Beta-Blockers, such as Carvedilol, Metoprolol, or Bisoprolol?\n",
      "Patient: You know, Beta-Blockers! That reminds me of how my old car used to have this really annoying sound when I pressed the gas pedal. It was like a little beta fish in a bowl, just bubbling away! Do you think cars have personalities too?\n",

      "Patient: You know, thiazide diuretics make me think about how my wife is always trying to get me to drink more water. She says hydration is key, but sometimes I feel like I’m just swimming with all the fluid! Speaking of swimming, do you enjoy any water activities?\n",
      "Doctor: That's a great reminder about hydration! Now, can you tell me if you are currently taking any loop diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: You know, loop diuretics remind me of this time I was at the lake with my family. We rented a boat, and I thought I’d be a natural, but I ended up splashing water everywhere! Have you ever had one of those days where everything just goes hilariously wrong?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a fun day at the lake! Now, let's get back to your health. Are you currently taking any Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists, such as Spironolactone or Eplerenone?\n",
      "Patient: You know, Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists remind me of my love for baking bread. There's something magical about watching the dough rise! It’s like waiting for a surprise. Do you bake often, or do you prefer cooking something savory?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds lovely! Baking bread can be a wonderful experience. Now, can you tell me if you are currently taking any medications like Hydralazine or nitrate medications such as Isosorbide Mononitrate or Isosorbide Dinitrate?\n",
      "Patient: You know, talking about Hydralazine makes me think of those summer barbecues we have in the backyard. Everyone gathers around, and I always end up making the drinks. I love mixing up something refreshing! What’s your go-to summer drink?\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a great way to bring people together! Now, can you let me know if you are currently taking Ivabradine?\n",
      "Patient: You know, Ivabradine reminds me of my love for reading. I just finished this mystery novel that had me on the edge of my seat! The twists and turns were so exciting. Do you enjoy a good mystery, or do you prefer something more lighthearted?\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Jose Benitez, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Hey there! You know, I've been thinking a lot about how the leaves change color in the fall. It's such a beautiful sight, isn't it? Makes me want to take a long stroll in the park. How's the weather been treating you?\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your thoughts on the beauty of fall, it's truly a lovely time of year. However, let's focus on how you've been feeling since your discharge. Can you tell me how you've been feeling today? Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, you know, I saw this interesting documentary about how dolphins communicate. They have such complex social structures! But about me, I think I've been a bit more tired than usual, you know?\n",
      "Doctor: I see, thank you for sharing that with me. Fatigue can be concerning, especially after your recent hospitalization. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, speaking of stairs, I remember when I used to climb all the way to the rooftop of my old apartment building to watch the sunset. It was such a magical view! But about the shortness of breath, I think I feel a bit more winded when I’m doing things lately.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear you have such fond memories of watching the sunset. I'm sorry to hear you're feeling more winded lately. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, you know what’s funny? I used to have this neighbor who would practice the saxophone at night. I could never tell if he was getting better or worse! But about waking up at night, sometimes I do feel a bit uncomfortable, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.\n",
      "Doctor: It's understandable to feel uncomfortable at times, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I just love how pillows can be so versatile! Sometimes I use them for my back while watching TV or even for reading. Speaking of comfort, I think I do use a couple more pillows at night, just to feel better when I’m lying down.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re taking steps to feel more comfortable. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I was just reminiscing about my childhood, and how my grandmother used to make the best tamales. The smell would fill the whole house! But, uh, about my legs, I think they feel a bit heavier these days, if that makes sense?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like those memories are really special. I'm sorry to hear your legs feel heavier; that could be a sign of fluid retention. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I once had this amazing dream where I was flying over the ocean. The colors of the water were just breathtaking! But about coughing, I think I might have a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but it’s nothing major, I don’t think.\n",
      "Doctor: It’s wonderful to hear about your dream; it sounds so serene! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts about your cough. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I was just thinking about how I used to love going to the beach and collecting seashells. There are so many different shapes and colors! As for chest pain, I can't really recall anything specific right now, but sometimes it feels like there's a little pressure, maybe?\n",
      "Doctor: It's lovely to hear about your beach memories. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on the pressure you feel; it’s important to keep an eye on that. Now, could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, temperatures! Speaking of which, I remember when my family would have those summer barbecues. We’d always try to guess which dish would be the most popular—my famous potato salad always took the prize! But, uh, I think my temperature is around 98 degrees, something like that.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that about your family barbecues! It's great to hear you have such cherished memories. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, heart rates! That reminds me of my old baseball days, watching my favorite team play. I used to get so excited, my heart would race like I was running the bases! But, um, I think my heart rate is around 60 beats per minute or so.\n",
      "Doctor: That's a steady heart rate; thank you for sharing! Next, could you please tell me your respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: You know, respiratory rates always make me think of how I used to go swimming in the ocean when I was younger. The feeling of the waves crashing and the fresh air was just invigorating! But as for my respiratory rate, I think it's around 18 breaths per minute.\n",
      "Doctor: It's wonderful to hear about your swimming experiences; they sound refreshing! Now, could you please tell me your oxygen saturation level?\n",
      "Patient: You know, oxygen saturation always reminds me of how important it is to breathe deeply while enjoying the fresh air at the park. I used to take long walks there, just me and my thoughts, watching the birds and squirrels. But I think my oxygen saturation is 100%.\n",
      "Doctor: That's wonderful to hear about your peaceful park walks! Now, could you please tell me your blood pressure?\n",
      "Patient: You know, blood pressure always makes me think about the time I tried to bake a cake for my niece's birthday. It was quite the adventure, flour everywhere! But I'm not sure about my blood pressure right now; I think it was around 150 over something?\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that baking memory; it sounds like a fun time! Let's move on to your weight. Could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, weight! That reminds me of the time I joined a community garden. We grew the biggest tomatoes! I was so proud of that harvest. But, uh, I think my weight is around 167 pounds, if I remember correctly.\n",

      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing your current medications with me. It's important to keep track of them. Just to clarify, how often are you taking your Furosemide?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, Furosemide! That takes me back to when I used to go fishing with my father. We would spend hours by the lake, just waiting for a bite—such peaceful times! But, uh, I think I take my Furosemide once a day, usually in the morning.\n",

      "======================================================================================================================================================\n",
      "Doctor: Hello Alicia Alvarado, I'm here to check on how you're feeling today. Let's go over how you've been doing since your discharge.\n",
      "Patient: Hey there! You know, I was just thinking about how nice it is to see the leaves changing colors this time of year. Do you think it means fall is officially here?\n",
      "Doctor: That's wonderful to hear! The changing leaves really do signal the arrival of fall. Now, can you tell me how you've been feeling today? Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, speaking of personal things, I just remembered how I used to bake pumpkin pies every fall for my family. Do you think they still miss my pies? Anyway, I’ve been feeling okay, I guess.\n",
      "Doctor: That sounds like a lovely tradition! I'm sure your family cherishes those memories. I’m glad to hear you’ve been feeling okay. Have you experienced any shortness of breath? If yes, does it occur at rest, when walking, or when climbing stairs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, shortness of breath! That reminds me of the time I went hiking with my friends, and I thought I could keep up with them. We ended up getting lost for hours! It was quite the adventure, but I don't think I could do that now.\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like quite the adventure, but it's important to listen to your body. Have you had sudden shortness of breath that wakes you up at night?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, waking up in the middle of the night! That reminds me of the time my neighbor’s dog barked all night long. I could hardly get any sleep! But now that you mention it, I haven’t really noticed anything like that lately.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you haven't had any issues with waking up at night. Do you need to prop yourself up with pillows to breathe comfortably while lying down?\n",
      "Patient: You know, I used to have this great pillow collection! I had all sorts of shapes and sizes, and I would change them out with the seasons. I wonder if that’s still a thing? Anyway, I haven’t really needed to prop myself up too much lately.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear that you haven't needed to prop yourself up too much. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or legs?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, swelling! That reminds me of the time I tried to wear those cute shoes to my niece's wedding. I thought I could handle them, but my feet were so swollen by the end of the night! Do you think there's a limit to how fancy you can get with shoes as you age? Anyway, I haven't really noticed any swelling in my legs lately.\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear you haven't noticed any swelling in your legs. Are you experiencing a cough, especially at night?\n",
      "Patient: You know, coughs can be so annoying! They remind me of that time I was at a concert, and someone behind me wouldn't stop coughing. It totally ruined my favorite song! But as for me, I haven't really had much of a cough lately.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you haven't had much of a cough lately. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, chest pain! That takes me back to when I was at a family barbecue, and someone accidentally spilled hot sauce all over the table. Everyone was laughing so hard, but I was worried about my favorite blouse! Anyway, I haven't really felt any chest pain recently.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm glad to hear you haven't felt any chest pain recently. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: You know, feeling tired makes me think about how I used to take afternoon naps every Sunday. There was something so cozy about curling up with a good book and falling asleep while the sun streamed in through the window. But as for my energy levels, I suppose I do feel a bit more tired than I used to.\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like those Sunday naps were quite enjoyable! I'm sorry to hear you're feeling a bit more tired than usual. Could you please provide your current temperature?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, temperature! That reminds me of how my grandmother used to say that a warm cup of tea was the best remedy for everything. I wonder if she ever really believed that! I think my temperature is around 97.4°F.\n",

      "Patient: Oh, Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors! That reminds me of the time I decided to take a painting class. I thought I could create a masterpiece, but my canvas ended up looking like a mix between a sunset and a spaghetti mess! Have you ever tried painting, or do you stick to your day job?\n",

      "Doctor: It’s great to hear about your love for movies! Now, could you please tell me if you're taking any Thiazide diuretics, such as Hydrochlorothiazide or Chlorthalidone?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, Thiazide diuretics! That reminds me of my last trip to the beach where I tried to build the biggest sandcastle. I was so focused on it that I didn't even notice the tide coming in! Do you think kids today still build sandcastles, or are they too busy with their phones?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like you had a great time at the beach! Now, could you please tell me if you're taking any Loop diuretics, such as Furosemide, Torsemide, or Bumetanide?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, Loop diuretics! That makes me think of how I used to take long walks in the park.

      "Doctor: I can imagine organizing a family reunion can be quite a task! Now, could you please tell me if you're taking any Hydralazine?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, Hydralazine! You know, that reminds me of my grandmother's old remedies. She used to swear by her special herbal concoctions, and I always wondered if they actually worked or if it was just her magic touch! Do you think some old remedies should get more credit than they do?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like your grandmother had some wonderful wisdom! Now, could you please tell me if you're taking any nitrate medications, such as Isosorbide Mononitrate or Isosorbide Dinitrate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, nitrate medications! That makes me think of the time I decided to try a new recipe for a spicy chili. I thought I could handle the heat, but boy, did I underestimate it! Have you ever tried something so spicy that it made you question your life choices?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like that chili was quite the adventure! Now, could you please tell me if you're taking Ivabradine?\n",

      "Patient: Oh, a cough! That takes me back to when I caught a cold last winter. I had this awful, raspy voice, and my friends thought I was trying to sound like a movie villain! Speaking of movies, have you watched any good thrillers lately? I love a good plot twist!\n",
      "Doctor: I love a good plot twist too! Let's focus on your health again. Have you had any chest pain recently?\n",
      "Patient: You know, chest pain makes me think of how I used to go hiking. There was this one time I underestimated the trail and ended up completely out of breath.

      "Doctor: It's nice to hear about your hiking adventures! Let's focus on your recovery. Do you feel more tired than usual or have you experienced any sudden changes in your mental clarity?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, feeling tired makes me think about those lazy Sunday afternoons where I'd just binge-watch shows on the couch. You know, I could never decide between a comedy or a drama! And have you ever noticed how snacks always seem to taste better when you're watching TV? What’s your favorite snack for movie night?\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like you have some wonderful memories associated with relaxing at home! Now, could you please provide your latest temperature?\n",

      "Doctor: I can see how unexpected weather can throw off your plans! Let's focus on your health. Could you please tell me your current heart rate?\n",
      "Patient: You know, heart rate makes me think of how I used to get so excited at concerts. The energy in the crowd would make my heart race! Speaking of concerts, have you heard about that band that's reuniting after years? I can't believe they're coming back to perform!\n",
      "Doctor: It sounds like concerts bring you a lot of joy! Let's get back to your health. What is your current respiratory rate?\n",
      "Patient: Oh, respiratory rate! That brings back memories of my high school gym class. We used to have to run laps around the track, and I always felt like I was competing against the clock. It was such a rush! By the way, have you seen those new fitness trackers? They seem so high-tech!\n",

      "Patient: You know, blood pressure makes me think of how I used to love watching those medical dramas on TV.

It was such a cliffhanger!\n",
      "Doctor: It's great to hear how much you enjoy medical dramas! Now, could you please tell me your current weight?\n",
      "Patient: You know, weight makes me think about how I used to try all these different diets. There was a phase where I was obsessed with smoothies and would make these crazy combinations. I even tried a kale and banana mix once! It was... interesting. Have you ever experimented with smoothies? What’s your favorite blend?\n",

It can be really fun!\n",
      "Doctor: I appreciate your thoughts on cooking and organizing! Let's focus on your health. Are you currently taking any ACE inhibitors, such as Lisinopril or Enalapril?\n",
      "Patient: You know, ACE inhibitors make me think about how I used to ace my math tests back in school. I was so proud when I got a perfect score! But then I realized I had no idea how to apply any of that to real life. Do you ever feel like school taught us things we never use?\n",

I feel like there's something nostalgic about those old-school arcade games!\n",
