      "### KEY GOALS\n",
      "1. **Ensure Comprehensive Symptom Reporting**: The summary must include all relevant symptoms mentioned in the transcript, particularly critical symptoms like 'orthopnea' and 'chest pain', which were frequently omitted in previous summaries. For example, the summary should explicitly state the patient's need for pillows to breathe comfortably, as this is a significant indicator of their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Accurate Vital Signs Representation**: The summary should accurately reflect the vital signs reported in the transcript, including blood pressure and weight, which were often missing or incorrect. For instance, if the transcript states a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, the summary should reflect this without discrepancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Avoid Interpretations or Diagnoses**: The summary must refrain from including any language that implies a diagnosis or clinical assessment, such as stating that symptoms are \"well managed\" or \"stable.\" Instead, it should focus solely on the patient's reported experiences and factual data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Structured Output in JSON Format**: The summary should adhere to JSON best practices, ensuring that the output is processable by downstream systems. This includes using proper key-value pairs and ensuring that all string values are appropriately formatted.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarity and Context**: The summary should provide context for symptoms where appropriate, enhancing clarity without adding unnecessary detail. For example, if the patient mentions feeling tired, the summary could briefly note how this affects their daily activities.\n",
