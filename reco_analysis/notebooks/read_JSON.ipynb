      "Patient: I haven't felt more tired than usual, but I have noticed that I get a bit lightheaded when I stand up quickly.\n",

      "Patient: My temperature today is 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, I'm also taking aspirin along with my other medications.\n",
      "Doctor: Thank you for sharing that, Jennifer. Are there any other medications or supplements that you are currently taking that we haven't discussed yet?\n",
